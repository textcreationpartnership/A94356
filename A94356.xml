            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:115824:4"/>reſpects, but chiefly in its riſe, worſe, more odious, and abominable than ever was power in the World before it;</hi> for as for all the three firſt Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, and the Fourth alſo (conſidered in its firſt ſtate, before the Antichriſtian Beaſt was Mid-wived into the World) they did receive their power from God, upon which account the Apoſtles in the New Teſtament urge obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ruling Powers of the World that then were, telling Beleevers to whom they wrote, that <hi>there was no power</hi> (i. e. then ſtanding) <hi>but what Originally, in reſpect of the derivation of the power, was of God, and ordained by God,</hi> Rom. 12.1. 1 Pet. 2.13, 14.</p>
                  <p>But now the power of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy in its ſecond State, as ſubjected to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt (which Beaſt was not then riſen, but to aſcend to the Throne afterwards, <hi>Revel.</hi> 17.8.) is (as in many other reſpects, ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in this, <hi>viz.</hi> of the firſt riſe or deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the power) made to differ vaſtly from all thoſe preceding powers, which were parts of the Great Image, as well as it; for <hi>thoſe,</hi> though their power was abuſed, yet had they it <hi>originally from God;</hi> but of the Antichriſtian Power the contrary is expreſly declared, namely, <hi>That when the Ten-Horned blaſphemous Beaſt ſhould ariſe, he ſhould receive
<pb facs="tcp:115824:4"/>his power from the Dragon, or Devil,</hi> Revel. 13.1, 2. <hi>And I ſaw a Beaſt riſe up out of the Sea, having ſeven Heads, and ten Horns, and upon his Horns ten Crowns, and upon his Heads the name of Blaſphemy. And the Beaſt that I ſaw was like unto a Leopard, and the Dragon gave him his power, and great authority.</hi> Hence, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.7. and again, Chap. 17.8. where his riſe is ſpoken of, he is ſaid, not to have a <hi>deſcent from Heaven,</hi> as had the former powers, but <hi>an aſcent out of the bottomleſs Pit,</hi> i.e. from Hell, noting (as before) that the <hi>derivation of this Power ſhould not bee from God, but from the Devil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which Poſition is yet more clear, if wee conſider, how that Jeſus Chriſt, all the time of the Beaſts Kingdom, doth ſet up a two fold power, viz. <hi>a power Magiſterial and Miniſterial,</hi> (which he calls his two Witneſſes, <hi>Revelation</hi> 11.3.) <hi>For this very end, to oppoſe the Beaſt, by bearing conſtant witneſs againſt, and ſmiting ſo farre as in them lyes, the Beaſt and his Powers.</hi> This witneſſe-bearing Power ſet up in direct oppoſition to the Beaſt, though in reſpect of their outward condition they are at and under all the time of the Beaſts Kingdom, he, till his day is out, ruling the roſt, for which cauſe they wear Sackcloth; yet being declaredly
<pb facs="tcp:115824:5"/>of Divine appointment, and ordination; <hi>I will give power to my two Witneſſes,</hi> hence it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily followeth, that the power of the Beaſt cannot be ſuch too, unleſſe we ſhould ſuppoſe Divine appointments to be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly contradictory within themſelves, and to fight the one with the other, which to ſay, would be rather a blaſphemy than an abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity. And it is for this reaſon, becauſe the Beaſt receives his power from the Dragon, that the Worſhippers of the Beaſt are ſaid to worſhip the Dragon, <hi>Revelations</hi> 13.4. <hi>And they worſhipped the Dragon that gave power to the Beaſt, and they worſhipped the Beaſt.</hi> From all which it appears, That Power conſidered as Antichriſtian is not of divine inſtitution, but Diabolical.</p>
                  <p>This Antichriſtian power is that which of all the Powers of the Four Monarchies takes laſt place, cloſing up the Worlds day, and ſtanding next to Chriſts Kingdom in regard of time, God ſeeing it beſt in his infinite and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable Wiſdom to ſuffer things, before he will erect his own Kingdom of righteouſneſs, and holineſs, to grow to ſuch a height of unparalelled impietie in the World, as that the principal affairs thereof, which in all Ages and Generations formerly had ever
<pb facs="tcp:115824:5"/>been ordered and diſpoſed by men, as his Subſtitutes, ſhould in this laſt time (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the time of Antichriſts Kingdom) bee diſpoſed of, and governed by men as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes of the Dragon.</p>
                  <p>In the ruines of this Power Chriſt begins his own Kingdom; for as the <hi>Perſian</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy had its beginning in the ruines of the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> and the <hi>Graecian</hi> in the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of the <hi>Perſian,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> afterwards in the ruines of the <hi>Graecian;</hi> ſo the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, or the Fifth Monarchy, hath its firſt riſe in the ruines of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Kingdom, with which (the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Kingdom being the Fourth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy in its ſecond and laſt ſtate) the Fourth Monarchy it ſelf goes to ruine, and way is made for the riſe of the Fifth, which ſucceeds it.</p>
                  <p>This thing is moſt evident in the two firſt of <hi>Daniels</hi> Prophecies, <hi>viz.</hi> That of the Great Image, Chap. 2. and that of the four Beaſts, Chap. 7. for the one tells us, that Chriſts Kingdom ariſeth <hi>by ſmiting and breaking the feet of the Great Image;</hi> the other, that it ariſeth <hi>by judging, caſting down the Throne, taking away the Dominion of the Little Horn,</hi> either of which are the ſame,
<pb facs="tcp:115824:6"/>both pointing (as the future Diſcourſe proveth at large) at the Kingdom of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, and Chriſts judging thereof.</p>
                  <p>Now, that this Kingdom of Chriſt, which <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeaks of, as ſucceeding the Kingdom of Antichriſt, taking its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the others ruines, cannot be a meer Spiritual Kingdom (as many would have it) but muſt bee an outward and viſible Kingdom, is manifeſt enough, though wee had no other proof thereof, but what is couched in theſe two Prophecies; though yet I might ſay it, and ſpeak truth, that this Doctrine of Chriſts viſible Kingdom, is that great Truth of which all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of the Old Teſtament, more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully than of any one beſides it, have ſpoken, and Chriſt himſelf, with the Apoſtles, and Evangeliſts, of the New likewiſe.</p>
                  <p>But (not to enter into ſo large a field, which requires a Book, not an Epiſtle) let us (becauſe the Rulers of this World begin at this day to be jealous of this Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to look bigge upon Chriſts out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Kingdom) conſult with <hi>Daniel</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Queſtion, Whether the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hee ſpeaks of in his two firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies be meerly Spiritual, or whether
<pb facs="tcp:115824:6"/>it bee not, as Spiritual, ſo outward too. And although ſome Arguments urged from <hi>Daniels</hi> firſt Prophecy, to prove this Kingdom to be not Spiritual only, but outward alſo, are laid down in our following Diſcourſe; yet do I not here judge it amiſſe to enlarge ſome of them, and alſo adde ſomething new, to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate thereby a <hi>moſt bleſſed,</hi> but <hi>ſuffering truth,</hi> hoping my labour in ſo doing may not be altogether loſt. Let us therefore (I ſay) ask <hi>Daniels</hi> minde upon our Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As for his <hi>Prophecy of the Great Image,</hi> Chapter two, the <hi>Stone,</hi> verſe thirty fourth, which is interpreted Chriſts Kingdom, verſe forty fourth, cannot be meant of Chriſts Spiritual Kingdom, but muſt neceſſarily point at an outward.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:115824:7"/>doth evidently manifeſt) in that order of ſucceſſion that they were to come forth in afterwards, beholds the Feet before yet hee ſees the Stone; as verſe thirty four, <hi>Thou ſaweſt till that a ſtone was cut out without hands, which ſmote the Image up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his feet;</hi> the ſeeing of the Stone cut out, and ſmiting, was after that the whole Image in its ſeveral parts had been preſented to him; therefore I ſay, as all the other parts, ſo likewiſe the Feet of the Image were in being before the Stone.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Becauſe <hi>Daniel</hi> beholds the Stone, ſo ſoon as formed, to ſmite the Feet, verſe thirty four, therefore muſt the Feet bee in being before the Stone was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Becauſe the Kingdom ſignified by the Stone is not ſet up till in the days of the ten Antichriſtian Kings, verſe forty four, <hi>And in the days of theſe Kings ſhall the God of Heaven ſet up a Kingdom.</hi> That theſe Kings can point at no other but the ten Antichriſtian Kings <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Revelations</hi> 17.12, 13, 14. See our future diſcourſe, page three hundred and eighteen, and three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb facs="tcp:115824:7"/>and nineteen. Now the Kingdom of the Stone being to bee ſet up in the days of the ten Antichriſtian Kings, therefore muſt the Antichriſtian State be before the Kingdom of the Stone. If ſo, then cannot Chriſts Spiritual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom be the thing ſignified by the Stone, for that was ſet up when Chriſt firſt gave forth his Spirit, immediatly upon his Aſcenſion, which was within the time that the Iron Leggs of the Image, verſe forty, <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy in its firſt, and as yet Pagan ſtate, did bear rule, being three hundred years and upwards before the Feet, <hi>viz.</hi> the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian State had exiſtence or being in the World. Chriſts Spiritual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom therefore being long before Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts Kingdom was begun; but the Kingdom of the Stone having not being till afterwards, it follows that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Stone cannot bee Chriſts Spiritual Kingdom, but muſt be an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>Second Reaſon, <hi>Becauſe</hi> it is <hi>the Stones proper and peculier work to break in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Great Image,</hi> i. e. outward Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:115824:8"/>
                  <p>Firſt, That it is its proper work, is clear, becauſe it doth the thing not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally, but intentionally, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid to do it by ſmiting, verſe thirty four, thirty five, &amp; forty five; which Phraſe notes the intention of the Agent, it ſmites the Great Image, with full purpoſe and reſolution to break it, and therefore obſerve, it never leaves ſmiting, after once it hath begun, till it hath beaten the Great Image to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry chaff and duſt, verſ. 35.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That it is its principal work, is clear, becauſe no other work is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Stone but this only, which ſheweth, that the Kingdom of the Stone is a Kingdom ſet up by God to perform this work, which in caſe it doth it not, it doth nothing. But now the proper and principal work of Chriſts Spiritual Kingdom is another thing, <hi>viz. The increaſing and edifying it ſelf in love;</hi> and it doth not at all intermeddle, much leſs undertake it as its proper and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal work, with the routing and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Worldly Powers, which if indeed it ſhould, then Chriſts Spiritual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom (the proper and principal work
<pb facs="tcp:115824:8"/>hereof being once rightly apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Saints, the Children of this Kingdom) would ſoon prove a thing of as dangerous conſequence to the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of this World, as the Doctrin of the Fifth Monarchy either is, or can be. But this I ſay is not the work of Chriſts Spiritual Kingdom, therefore cannot the Kingdom of the Stone bee Chriſts Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Kingdom, but muſt bee an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>Third Reaſon, <hi>Becauſe the Kingdom of the Stone is ſuch a Kingdom, as that the ſtanding and continuance of the Great I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage is altogether inconſiſtent with the growth and proſperity thereof;</hi> which is clear, becauſe it neither doth, nor can grow up to be a great Mountain, filling the whole Earth, till the total removal of the Great Image, verſe thirty five. But now the ſtanding and continuance of the Great Image is no way inconſiſtent with the growth and proſperity of Chriſts Spiritual Kingdom, but rather is indeed advantagious unto it, as the Perſecutions that Chriſts Spiritual Kingdom hath met with, and that in all Ages, from the Great Image, which have always been
<pb facs="tcp:115824:9"/>the greateſt and moſt effectual means of its growth, and fruitfulneſs, do bear witneſs; therefore cannot the Spiritual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt bee the Kingdom here meant.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Becauſe the <hi>Kingdom of the Stone is a Kingdom in reſpect of Nature, the ſame with the Kingdoms repreſented by the Great Image,</hi> i. e. <hi>it is outward as they are outward;</hi> which appears,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 From the general ſcope and drift of the Prophecy which runs upon outward Kingdoms, all the firſt four Kingdoms, or Monarchies are outward, as none can deny; why then the Holy Ghoſt in ſpeaking of the Fifth and laſt ſhould ſo farre vary his ſcope, as preſently to glide from the outward Kingdom to the inward, ought (beſides the bare ſay ſo) to have ſome ſolid and ſubſtantial rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon brought for it, by thoſe, whoſoever they are, that either do or ſhall aſſert it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Becauſe it is not proper to ſay, that a bare Spiritual Kingdom, conſidered on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as Spiritual ſhould break in peeces, beat to very chaffe; grind to Powder the Great Image, <hi>i. e.</hi> deſtroy the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:115824:9"/>of worldly Kingdoms, which work is yet notwithſtanding done by the Stone, as Verſ. 35.44, 45. Indeed Chriſts Spiritual Kingdom may by that light and life it gives forth, much refine, and reform outward Kingdoms, but when once the work comes to breaking and beating to pecoes, <hi>i.e.</hi> ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Kingdoms, razing their very foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and deſtroying their being, as they are the Kingdoms of this World, here (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we conceive God to do it by a Miracle) muſt we alſo conceive ſome other hand, beſides a Spiritual, to bee put to the work.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Becauſe the Stone, to the end there might not be a vacancy in the world, comes ſtraightway in the place and room of the Great Image, ſo ſoon as ever the ſame is totally broken, verſe thirty five; for as the Great Image, while ſtanding, bears rule over all the earth, verſe thirty nine, ſo the ſame being broken, the Stone becomes a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and fills the whole Earth, verſe thirty five, therefore muſt the Kingdom of the ſtone be ſuch a Kingdom as was that of the Great Image, <hi>viz.</hi> outward, or otherwiſe the coming of that in the place of the other now taken away, could not ſupply the
<pb facs="tcp:115824:10"/>want of the other. From all which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (and ſome others alſo that are laid down in the following Diſcourſe, page one hundred and five, one hundred and ſix.) It is clear, That the Kingdom of the Stone, mentioned <hi>Daniel</hi> 2. cannot be a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Kingdom, but muſt be an outward. Thus much from <hi>Daniels</hi> firſt Prophecy.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As for <hi>that Kingdom Daniel</hi> ſpeaks of in his <hi>Second Prophecy,</hi> Chapter ſeven, which is there ſaid to be <hi>given to the Saints,</hi> and to ſucceed (in reſpect of the greatneſs and glory of it, though not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the beginnings) <hi>the Kingdom of the Little Horn,</hi> that it cannot be a Spiritual Kingdom, but muſt alſo be an outward and viſible, is clear, for theſe reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt Reaſon, <hi>Becauſe it is a Kingdom in which outward judgement is given to the Saints,</hi> verſe twenty two, <hi>Judgement was given to the Saints of the moſt High.</hi> This Judgement muſt be outward, becauſe the effect of it is ſuch, <hi>viz.</hi> a caſting down the Thrones of the Fourth Beaſt, verſe nine, by conſequence therefore the Kingdom it ſelf muſt be ſuch.</p>
                  <p>Second Reaſon, <hi>Becauſe it is a Kingdom the Saints are ſaid to poſſeſſe,</hi> verſe twenty
<pb facs="tcp:115824:10"/>two, <hi>The time came that the Saints poſſeſſed the Kingdom,</hi> but it is more proper to ſay of the Spiritual Kingdom that it poſſeſſeth them, than they it.</p>
                  <p>Third Reaſon, <hi>Becauſe it is the very ſame Kingdom which was before governed by the Little Horn, that is given to the Saints;</hi> now that being an outward Kingdom, ſuch muſt the Kingdom given to the Saints be alſo.</p>
                  <p>That the Kingdom given to the Saints is the very ſame Kingdom that the Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Horn did before poſſeſs, is clear, from the plain words and expreſſions uſed by the Holy Ghoſt, verſe twenty one, twenty two, <hi>I beheld, and the ſame Horn made War with the Saints, and prevailed againſt them; until the Ancient of days came, and Judgement was given to the Saints of the moſt High, and the time came that the Saints poſſeſſed the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> Note, we do not read it, That the Saints poſſeſſed a Kingdom upon this their judging of the Little Horn, but <hi>the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> teaching us thus much, That that very Kingdom which the Saints by judging the Little Horn do take from him, they themſelves do afterwards poſſeſſe. So verſe ſeventeen and eighteen, <hi>Theſe great Beaſts which are four, are four Kings which
<pb facs="tcp:115824:11"/>ſhall ariſe out of the earth; but the Saints of the moſt High <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eall take the Kingdom, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the Kingdom for ever, even for ever, and ever.</hi> Obſerve, the Kingdom, or that very Kingdom which was before governed by the four great Beaſts, and by the Little Horn, as the laſt Limb of the Fourth Beaſt, is the Kingdom that the Saints take, i.e. from this Little Horn, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently from all the Beaſts, or Powers, his Predeceſſors, and having taken it, do poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe it for ever and ever, i.e. it ſhall never be taken from them again, as they took it from all the other. So verſe twenty ſix, twenty ſeven, <hi>But the Judgement ſhall ſit, and they ſhall take away his Dominion, to conſume, and to deſtroy it unto the end. And the Kingdom, and Dominion, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Kingdom under the whole Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſhall be given to the people of the Saints of the moſt High, whoſe Kingdom is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Kingdom, and all Dominions ſhall ſerve and obey him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve, The Saints, in the Evening of the Little Horns Kingdom, are by the Decree of Heaven conſtituted a High Court of Juſtice; hereupon they ſit in Judgement, by ſitting in Judgement
<pb facs="tcp:115824:11"/>they take away his Dominion; Whoſe? Why, the Little Horns, upon whom the Diſcourſe runs; but what becomes of it when they have taken it away, &amp; deſpoiled him of it? why, it is by God given to them, <hi>the Kingdom, and Dominion, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Kingdom under the whole Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhall be given to the people of the Saints of the moſt High.</hi> Which yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (beſides the general ſcope which ſhews this to bee the ſame Kingdom with that of the Little Horn) that this Kingdom ſhould bee an outward King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the uſe of that Phraſe, <hi>the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the kingdom under the whole Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> which cannot without forcing the words be reſtrained to a Spiritual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom only, doth neceſſarily import. The Kingdom of the Saints therefore, which <hi>Daniel</hi> in his ſecond Prophecy makes mention of, cannot bee a meer Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Kingdom, but is, and muſt be an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>But now as it was the great <hi>Maſter-peice</hi> of Satans policy at the time of Chriſts <hi>firſt coming,</hi> when hee ſet up his Spiritual Kingdom, <hi>to put that Generation of men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together upon looking after the outward king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:115824:12"/>drawing them thereby to a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of that Kingdom, which they in that day ought ſpecially to have atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to: So is it his <hi>great engine of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy</hi> in the days a little before Chriſts <hi>ſecond coming,</hi> when now Chriſt is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and in truth, entring into the World to ſet up his outward Kingdom, <hi>to turn the eyes of this Generation altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the Spiritual Kingdom,</hi> draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them thereby off from the outward, hereby cunningly holding forth one truth as a bait to allure from another, and endeavouring to draw the hearts of men from the great truth of the Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by preſenting them with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truth, every way as glorious, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in it ſelf (the time and ſeaſon only, which is ſtill the thing that adds beauty to Generation-truth, ſet aſide) as the truth it ſelf of the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Upon the fore-going Principle, <hi>That Chriſt is to have an outward viſible King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the ſcope of the following Diſcourſe, which proves that the time of ſetting up this Kingdom is now approaching, and upon us,</hi> doth it not neceſſarily follow, that <hi>all
<pb facs="tcp:115824:12"/>thoſe who in this day, ſhall by their ſayings or actings be found to have any hand in keeping Chriſt from his Throne, are by ſo doing become guilty of High Treaſon againſt this King of Kings, and though they may and ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape the judgement of man, may they not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect</hi> (in caſe they remember not from whence they are fallen, and repent) <hi>to be arraigned as ſuch before his Throne another day, who will then paſſe a Judgement of perſons and things, not as they are in mens interpretations, but according as he hath left them in his Word?</hi> yea, let it be ſeriouſly conſidered, and laid to heart, whether or no the condemning this bleſſed Doctrin, the glorious truth of the Age, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Fifth Monarchy, or Chriſts viſible Kingdom (conſidering that no five Parties this day in <hi>England</hi> have ſo much to ſay from the Word for their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular opinions, though all they have to ſay be put together, as may be ſaid for this) be a thing juſtifiable before Gods people, or rather in the ſight of God and out Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, eſpecially too when as the perſons condemning, have never to this day given the truth a fair hearing, by uſing ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours for the finding out the minde of God in this thing, as they might, and
<pb facs="tcp:115824:13"/>as lies in their power to do, and which, were there nothing elſe but the diſ-ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Gods people, God declares from Heaven that he calls upon them to do? yea whether or no is not this very act of theirs a dealing more injuriouſly with the bleſſed Truth of Chriſt, the leaſt ïota of which is of farre greater worth than Men and Angels, than ever did the Pagan Powers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in the Apoſtles days, with the perſons of particular men (though Malefactors) who always refuſed to paſs a Sentence till they had heard what the accuſed could ſpeak? <hi>Acts</hi> 25.16. yea whether or no ſuch perſons whoſe words and actions are Patterns unto Multitudes, will not have much to anſwer for (unleſs they repent) if ſo be Chriſt ſhall one day finde it, that by their ſlight ſpeeches, or frowning car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages towards the truth of the Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the generality of poor ſouls that know nothing, but are meerly led by example, ſhall be emboldned, encouraged to ſlight, revile, oppoſe, perſecute that truth in which his honour is more nearly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly concerned, than in any other truth beſides it? And is it not poſſible that
<pb facs="tcp:115824:13"/>a man with a faithful and upright heart, (but conſidered as miſtaken, or darkned in his Principles) may do all this? Did not <hi>Paul</hi> act with an upright heart, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering he acted zealouſly according to his light, whilſt yet he perſecuted the Church, and the true way of the Lord? And in ſuch Caſes, is it not the better and ſafer way for a man to fear his own heart, and to be jealous that it acts under ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper, and ſo makes not a judgement of it ſelf in the light of the Lords Spirit, but in the darkneſs of temptation, than to bee confident of it, eſpecially too when a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral fear of ſuch a thing dwells upon the hearts of Gods people? <hi>David</hi> concluded himſelf then for certain to be under a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, when he ſaw that otherwiſe hee muſt condemn the generation of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.15. Much more I could ſay, but that it is no delight to dig into a Wound.</p>
                  <p>To conclude therefore, ſeeing the viſage of our times (both in reſpect of the great oppoſition this day made to the truth of the age, and in many other reſpects) is grown pale and black, and that bleſſed Cauſe of Chriſt, that of late looked with a
<pb facs="tcp:115824:14"/>freſh and amiable countenance, begins now to appear wan with Death in the face of it, is it not high time for the Saints, and all thoſe who wiſh well to <hi>Sion,</hi> to <hi>cry mightily</hi> to the Lord, and to give him no reſt, to <hi>humble themſelves greatly</hi> before him, for thoſe manifold abominations committed in the Land, eſpecially that Pride, Luke-warmneſs, Wantonneſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſs for Mercies paſt, love of this preſent World, open licentiouſneſs, groſs Apoſtacy, that ſuperabounds even among thoſe that bear upon them the Name of the Lord, which things have given our Father juſt cauſe, not only thus to frown, but to depart from us for ever? Yea, is it not high time, if wee have a tongue for Chriſt, now to ſpeak for him? if bowels, now to ſympathize with him? if tears in our eyes, now to pour them forth before the Lord? if groans in our hearts, now to ſend them up into Heaven? if faith in the Word and promiſe of God, now to act it? if exhortations in our Breaſts, now to bring them forth, and ſpeak often one to another? and will not the Lord hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and hear? and ſhall not a Book of remembrance be written before him, for
<pb facs="tcp:115824:14"/>them that now fear the Lord, and call upon his Name? Yea, will not God ſay concerning them, <hi>and they ſhall bee mine in the day when I make up my Jewels, and though they are Children full of failings, yet for this ſervice ſake I will ſpare them, as a man ſpareth his own Son that ſerveth him?</hi> ſurely he will.</p>
                  <p>And ſhould not this conſideration ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to all the reſt, that the ſet time of our Redemption is at hand (which dwelling every day more and more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my heart, hath cauſed mee to ſpeak) work up our hearts to all theſe things, and beget in us noble reſolutions to hazard whatever is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to us in the World, for the ſake of Chriſt, and his now deſpiſed Cauſe? which though trampled upon at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, yet ſhall it ſuddenly ariſe with Power and great Glory, and then ſhall all its enemies melt away before it, as the Snow before the Sun; then ſhall the Armies of Heaven march forth with the Lord in the Head of them, and the Princes ſhall bee afraid of his Enſigne, whoſe fire is in <hi>Sion,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:115824:15"/>his furnace in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The zeal of the Lord of Hoſts will perform this. So beleeves he, and ſo he prays, who is,</p>

                              <hi>That the Holy Ghoſt hath expreſly foretold that Saints at the time of the end, ſhall make diligent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into theſe things.</hi> This I take to be the thing noted in thoſe words, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Daniel</hi> in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Viſion had had the three laſt Monarchies, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> 2 <hi>Grecians,</hi> 3 <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> repreſented to him. The <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy (which is the laſt) is repreſented in its twofold ſtate; 1 In its pure civil ſtate; 2 In its mixt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian ſtate. All which things occaſion will be offered to handle more fully in the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. Now obſerve, after all theſe things had paſſed before <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Viſion, then as the very laſt thing of all, <hi>Daniel</hi> hears a <hi>diſcourſe of Saints</hi> upon our Queſtion; <hi>Then I heard one Saint ſpeaking,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115824:19"/>and another Saint ſaid unto that certain Saint which ſpake, How long shall be the Viſion concerning the daily ſacrifice, and the tranſgreſſion of deſolation, to give both the Sanctuary and the Hoſt to be trodden underfoot?</hi> The particle <hi>[then]</hi> denotes the thing to be ſucceſſive in time, as well as in place; that is, after <hi>Daniel</hi> had ſeen the whole Viſion, firſt the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> come forth, and for a while make a great noiſe in the world, but in the end va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh; Then the <hi>Grecians,</hi> who alſo for a time make ſome ſtir, and then vaniſh: After them the <hi>Romans,</hi> who firſt conquer Nations as they were a civil ſtate; then ſecondly, rage againſt the true worſhip of God, the holy City, and the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants thereof, as they are an Antichriſtian ſtate. Now in the concluſion of all, after all theſe things had paſſed before <hi>Daniel,</hi> and he ſaw this laſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, in its laſt ſtate upon the nick of vaniſhing away, as were already the former, then <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpecially obſerves another thing, of which he had not ſeen the like all the time and way before, <hi>viz. He beholds many Saints, and they are in very deep ſerious diſcourſe, and the ſubject of all their diſcourſe is this Queſtion,</hi> HOW LONG SHALL IT BE TO THE END OF WONDERS? or <hi>How long ſhall the Viſion be?</hi> To which Queſtion of theirs, <hi>Daniel</hi> hears anſwer given, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately thereupon the whole Viſion is at an end; onely the interpretation of it comes in afterwards; ſo that it is evident theſe words are properly the laſt in place and time both, of the whole Viſion, which clearly affords us this Obſervation:</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>That Saints in the time of the end, ſhall be much
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115824:20"/>upon this Enquiry, How long it ſhall be unto the end of Wonders?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This is farther clear from <hi>Daniels</hi> great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, Chap. 11, &amp; 12. in which two Chapters <hi>Daniel</hi> hath the very ſame thing, <hi>viz.</hi> the three laſt Monarchies declared to him by way of Voice, which in the former he ſaw by way of Viſion. Now after the declaration of the whole, <hi>Daniel</hi> Chap. 12. verſ. 5, 6. ſeeth two men ſtanding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt which is a River, and one is on the one ſide, and the other on the other. A fit reſemblance of <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> ready to unite, yet not fully uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for ſtill there is a River betwixt them, which argues that theſe words relate to the time a little before the coming in of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> ſhall be upon the very bank of union, yet not united. Of theſe two, one propounds a Queſtion to the man cloathed in linnen upon the waters of the River, <hi>How long ſhall it be unto the end of theſe Wonders?</hi> This Queriſt I conceive to be not other then the <hi>Gentile Saints;</hi> and my reaſon is, becauſe verſ. 7. anſwer to him is made in the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi> Dialect of a time, times, and a half, which is a time proper to the <hi>Gentile</hi> Churches, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.14. and not to the <hi>Jews.</hi> And further I look upon the Enquirer here to be the very ſame for time and perſons both, with that Chap. 8.13. Onely with this difference, the Enquirers, though many, are here called but one, becauſe in oppoſition to the <hi>Jews</hi> we have one here put for the whole body of the <hi>Gentile</hi> Saints; there they are ſpoken of as many, becauſe in that Text is no ſuch oppoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile.</hi>

                           <p>Now from the whole I make up this Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>That in the time of the end, a little before the Jews coming in, and Antichriſts fall, ſhall be great Enquiries made among the Gentile Saints, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the end of Wonders.</hi> And if ſo, then in caſe we are fallen into that time (as what I have ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in my Key, and have farther to ſay, will manifeſt that we are) this Enquiry is not onely <hi>juſtifiable,</hi> but <hi>neceſſary,</hi> it being the <hi>great truth of this Age.</hi>

                              <hi>That the Holy Ghoſt hath left particular and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ground for the faith of Gods people in the laſt dayes to go to God upon for light and knowledge in this thing.</hi> I ſay not onely, that the promiſe made to runners to and fro, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.4. <hi>that knowledge ſhall be increaſed,</hi> is, yea ought to be (for why is it elſe left upon Record?) a ground for our faith to build upon in making this Enquiry; nor onely, that the particular anſwers given to the Queriſts, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. and Chap. 12. is, yea ſhould be another; for why is particular anſwer given to the Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, but to ſhew that upon a ſober humble and beleeving Enquiry a knowledge of the thing ſought after ſhould be given forth? But that which I chiefly aim at, is, the particular aſſurance left us in the word that the ſealed Book of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies ſhould be unſealed, the words opened, the underſtanding of the Viſion made manifeſt to the Saints at, or in time of the end; For this ſee <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.4. <hi>But thou, O Daniel, ſhut up the words and ſeal the Book, even to the time of the end.</hi> The Book is to be ſcaled, the words therein ſhut up;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115824:21"/>But how long? Why, but till <hi>the time of the end;</hi> then Book and Words both are to be opened and read.</p>
                           <p>So verſ. 9. <hi>Go thy way Daniel, for the words are cloſed up till the time of the end. Daniel</hi> heard the anſwer given by the man that was cloathed in Linnen, verſ. 7. to the Enquirer, verſ. 6. but ſaith he, <hi>I underſtood not;</hi> therefore from a deſire to know, <hi>Daniel</hi> himſelf puts the Queſtion, verſ. 8. to whom anſwer is given, verſ. 11.12. but withall obſerve, <hi>Daniel</hi> hath firſt a kind of gracious check, <hi>Go thy way Daniel, for the words are cloſed up untill the time of the end;</hi> as to ſay, <hi>Daniel,</hi> thou wouldeſt fain have the knowledge of theſe things preſently, but go thy way <hi>Daniel;</hi> for the time of Revelation is the time of the end; though I will give thee the words now, yet the unſealing of them ſhall not be till the time of the end, when (and not before) my mind in theſe ſealed myſteries ſhall be made known to my children.</p>
                           <p>Sutable hereunto are the words, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.17. which words I have ſhewed in my Key, <hi>Theſi</hi> 3. are not to bee underſtood of the time of the Viſion, nor the ſubject matter thereof, but of the underſtanding of the Viſion, which though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in part to <hi>Daniel</hi> then, yet was not to be fully and clearly opened untill the time of the end.</p>
                           <p>The Concluſion is, That at the time of the end, the Book is to be unſealed, the underſtanding of the Viſion to be made known; and if ſo, then ſurely this our practice, we being fallen into the lap of the laſt times, is juſtifiable; for why hath
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115824:21"/>God ſo long before given aſſurance that then he will unſeal the Book, open the words, but onely to this end, that our faith, when this time comes on, might as in other things, ſo in this, wait upon him for light and knowledge.</p>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115824:22"/>forth in them, then by the ſame rule of all, where (I ſay) appears not ſome ſolid reaſon to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. This premiſed, my Reaſons that a defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite time is held forth in the myſtical Numbers of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the <hi>Revelations, are theſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1 Becauſe <hi>They are all broken Numbers;</hi> the two thouſand and three hundred dayes, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.14. is a broken Number; for although the three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred is a round Number in reſpect of Hundreds, yet it is a broken Number in reſpect of Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, which is the way of numbring here. Upon the ſame account, but more evident, the one thouſand two hundred and ninety, the one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand three hundred thirty five dayes, Chap. 12. <hi>Johns</hi> one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes, his two and forty months are all broken Numbers.</p>
                        <p>Now it is a Maxime among Interpreters, that notwithſtanding round numbers do ſometimes ſignifie an indefinite time, yet broken numbers ever a definite.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Becauſe <hi>If they ſignifie not a definite time, no account can be made up from them;</hi> for who can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine what is indefinite, or make up an account from uncertain numbers? But now the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Holy Ghoſt in laying them down, is, that from them an account might be made up, as is cleer.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 Becauſe the ſcope of the Queſtions propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. and <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. to which the myſtical Numbers there mentioned, are given in as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, doth look at ſuch a determined time as known; ſome certain concluſion concerning the time, How long the things revealed ſhould be in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115824:22"/>accompliſhing, might from thence be drawn up; therefore the Queſtions do not run thus, <hi>Shall theſe things be long, O Lord in doing?</hi> but thus, <hi>How long ſhall the Viſion be?</hi> Dan. 8.13. <hi>How long ſhall it be to the end of theſe Wonders?</hi> Chap. 12.6. the thing enquired after in both, is a certain deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined time.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Becauſe the Holy Ghoſt doth lay down a particular head of account, Chap. 12.11. Now this is never uſed but onely there where ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is to be made up. But were the time inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, there could (as before I have ſaid) be no making up of any account.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 <hi>Reaſ.</hi> Becauſe <hi>ſhould we look upon them as holding forth onely an indefinite time, ſignifying no more but a long time, there would be manifeſt Tauto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie in laying them down.</hi> For in <hi>Daniels</hi> Viſion, Chap. 8. where is recorded his two thouſand three hundred dayes, verſ. 14. it is ſaid over and above, verſ. laſt. <hi>The Viſion ſhall be for many dayes:</hi> If now the two thouſand three hundred dayes ſignifie onely a long time, it is the ſame with the other. So in <hi>Daniels</hi> Viſion Chap. 10, ch. 11, and ch. 12. where the one thouſand two hundred and ninety, the one thouſand three hundred thirty five dayes are ſpoken of, it is ſaid moreover, Chap. 10.1. <hi>The time appointed was long:</hi> The very ſame with the other, if not a dertain time but a long time onely be intended.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 Becauſe <hi>For this very reaſon</hi> Daniel 8. verſ. laſt, <hi>it is ſaid the Viſion of the evening and morning is true.</hi> The Viſion of the morning and evening hath a particular and peculiar reference to the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115824:23"/>two thouſand three hundred dayes, verſ. 14. (or as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> reads it, <hi>two thouſand three hundred mornings and evenings.</hi>) Now <hi>Daniel</hi> in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going verſes, from verſ. 20. having had the whole Viſion in an orderly manner interpreted to him, in the concluſion of all, leſt <hi>Daniel</hi> ſhould doubt of the time aſſigned of <hi>two thouſand three hundred mornings and evenings</hi> (which was the very laſt thing of the Viſion, and is here of the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation) it is added, <hi>The Viſion of the evening and morning is true,</hi> that is, the two thouſand three hundred dayes, which thou heardeſt mention made of in the cloſe of the Viſion, are a certain and determined time, and therefore verſ. 19. the time is ſaid to be a ſet time, or an appointed time; <hi>At the time appointed the end ſhall be.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5 Becauſe <hi>God in former times under the Old Teſtament, hath ever meaſured out the Bondage and Captivity of his Church by ſet and determined times.</hi> Four hundred and thirty years was the time in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and this time ſet to a very day, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.41, 51.

But now were the time held forth in theſe myſtical Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers an indefinite time onely, there ſhould be no certain ground for any of theſe: And hence it would follow that the people of God in the laſt dayes ſhould inſtead of having a more clear word of Propheſie, have a more doubtful ground for their faith and prayer in this reſpect, then had Gods people in times of old.</p>
                        <p>The Concluſion is, <hi>That the myſtical Numbers of</hi> Daniel <hi>and the</hi> Revelations, <hi>do hold forth to us a certain definite and determined time.</hi>

                        <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Clearing and confirming our general Diſtinction,</hi> viz. <hi>That the end of the Beaſts Tyranny, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to one time; the end of the fourth Monarchy to another.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>IT is a truth, <hi>Nothing can be rightly defined, which is not firſt rightly divided.</hi> The very reaſon (as to the creature) why mens conceptions have been ſo dark as to the mind of the Holy Ghoſt in the myſtical Numbers of <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> hath ſeemed to me to be this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they who have undertaken the work, have not applied diſtinct numbers to their diſtinct times, but either carried them all in a heap, or handled them all ſeverally, <hi>i. e.</hi> made all to end at one and the ſame ending point, or made as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ending points as there are divers numbers. Now of theſe two, the firſt inevitably breeds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion throughout all the Propheſies of the Old and New Teſtament; the laſt leaves in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer after the moſt diligent ſearch a ſeed and a ground of doubting, becauſe the light he hath attained, is a word eſtabliſhed onely by the mouth of one witneſſe, and that witneſſe too (which makes the ſuſpicion greater) muſt of neceſſity be, where firſt numbers are not rightly diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, for a principal part of its teſtimony, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, where I am to begin, or how to carry on the account having begun, onely humane; it being impoſſible for that man who would carry up
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115824:24"/>each number ſeverally, to find divine Teſtimony either for the beginning, or carrying on of any one number; for of this kind of teſtimony; though there is ſufficient left us in the word for each num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, both where to begin it, and how to carry it on, yet all is couched in the Harmony; and the Harmony it ſelf depends upon a right diviſion; ſo that conſequently, this wanting, we have nothing left us but humane teſtimony (which is a thing fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, and no ground of faith) to warrant the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, or carrying on of any particular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that we have either in <hi>Daniel,</hi> or the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That therefore we might have firm ground and ſure footing here, I have in my Key, <hi>Theſi</hi> 15. laid down (as the foundation of all) this Diſtinction, namely <hi>to diſtinguiſh betwixt the time of the Jews firſt ſtirring, and their compleat deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;</hi> betwixt the time where an end is put to the Beaſts Reign and Tyranny, and his final deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; or (which is all one in reſpect of time with the other) betwixt Chriſt ſtanding up in his Witneſſes, and his ſtanding up in his Perſon.</p>
                        <p>Now although the <hi>Harmony</hi> that by vertue of this diſtinction is brought forth betwixt all the myſtical Numbers (of which in my Key, <hi>Theſ.</hi> 63.) be Argument ſufficient to make the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction valid, yet that it may appear that all our ground for it lies not here, I ſhall briefly ſhew what particular ground and warrant beſides it, we have in the word for this Diſtinction.</p>
                        <p>For the firſt branch, which concerns <hi>the Jews delivery,</hi> our ground is ſo clear from <hi>Daniels</hi>
                           <pb n="16" facs="tcp:115824:25"/>diſtinguiſhing of times, Chap. 12. verſ. 11, 12. (where he treats of his own Nation more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally) firſt one thouſand two hundred and ninety dayes, then one thouſand three hundred thirty five, that the truth needs no explication.</p>
                        <p>And although that Diviſion of times made by <hi>Daniel</hi> is foundation ſufficient for our whole diſtinction, conſidering that the end of the Beaſts Reign, and the Witneſſes Reſurrection, are things contemporary with the <hi>Jews</hi> firſt ſtirring, as is proved <hi>Key, Theſi</hi> 17. and alſo Chriſts Perſonal appearance, and the final deſtruction of the Beaſt or fourth Monarchy, contemporary with their compleat deliverance, as alſo ſee our <hi>Key, Theſi</hi> 34. yet becauſe I will not lay the weight of ſo material a diſtinction upon that ſingle Text onely, I ſhall produce other Scripture grounds which warrant this diſtinction.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.26, 27. A manifeſt diſtinction is made betwixt <hi>the end</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> the final deſtruction) of the little Horn, (<hi>i.e.</hi> Antichriſt) and the <hi>taking away his Dominion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>His Dominion is taken away at the <hi>end of the time, times, and a half,</hi> which is the very day of the Witneſſes Reſurrection; <hi>i.e.</hi> the Beaſts Reign and Tyranny ſhall expire with the time of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes riſe; but obſerve, his final deſtruction is not as yet; for after his Dominion is taken away, there is betwixt that, and his end, a time of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming and deſtroying him by degrees, till at laſt upon Chriſts Perſonal appearance, a totall deſtruction comes upon him, and thereby a tranſlation of the fourth Monarchy to the Saints.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115824:25"/>verſ. 26. <hi>He ſhall ſpeak great words againſt the moſt High, and ſhall wear out the Saints of the moſt High, and think to change Times and Laws, and they ſhall be given into his hand, untill a time, times, and the dividing of time,</hi> verſ. 26. <hi>But the judgement ſhall ſit, and they ſhall take away his Dominion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume and deſtroy it unto the end.</hi> verſ. 27. <hi>And the Kingdome and Dominion, and the greatneſſe of the Kingdome under the whole Heaven, ſhall be given to the people of the Saints of the moſt High, whoſe Kingdome is an everlaſting Kingdome, and all Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions ſhall ſerve and obey him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. It is evident that ſo ſoon as the Witneſſes riſe, the treading underfoot the holy City by the Beaſt is at an end; for as the two and forty months of the Beaſts continuance, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.5. are interpreted, Chap. 11.2. by another phraſe of treading underfoot the holy City, are the ſame, and therefore both end together; no longer, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the mind of the Holy Ghoſt, Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>. 13.5. may he be ſaid to continue, then he treads under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot the holy City. So it is moſt evident that the two and forty months of treading underfoot the holy City, ends with the end of the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes of the Witneſſes wearing Sackcloth; for what cauſeth the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to wear Sackcloth, but this, becauſe the holy City is trodden underfoot? therefore with the end of the one, the other ends. But now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve upon the Witneſſes riſe, and putting off their Sackcloth, where ends the Beaſts Tyranny, not the whole Kingdome of the Beaſt is deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but a tenth part onely, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.13. <hi>And the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115824:26"/>ſame hour the tenth part of the City fell.</hi> Yea far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſerve, after the Witneſſes riſe, we read of a third wo to come quickly; therefore not come yet, verſ. 14. <hi>The ſecond woe is paſt, and behold the third woe cometh quickly.</hi> And of this woe the Beaſt bears a part, as well as Chriſts other enemies, and therefore not yet finally deſtroyed. Yea farther, (which ſerves us as a clear demonſtration of the thing in hand) we read of the Beaſt as one of the grand Leaders in the battel of <hi>Armageddon;</hi> Now as this battel ſucceeds the ruine of <hi>Rome</hi> (as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly I have proved) ſo doth the ruine of <hi>Rome</hi> ſucceed the riſe of the Witneſſes, whoſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment comes in a way of revenge of their quarrel <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.6. of neceſſity therefore the riſe of the Witneſſes, and conſequently the end of the Beaſts Reign, which expires with the other, muſt be, yea and that ſome time, before the laſt and final de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Beaſt.</p>
                        <p>To ſay, we finde the Beaſt raging even at the battel of <hi>Armageddon,</hi> as appears, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.19. therefore the two and forty months of the Beaſt muſt be extended as far as that day; and if ſo, then our diſtinction is invalid.</p>
                        <p>I anſwer, True, the Beaſt ſhall then rage, and his rage at that day ſhall make him ſtark mad; but with what rage? not with the proud inſulting rage of a Conqueror, as he did all the time of the two and forty months, but with the mad and diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rage of a loſer; before he overcame the Saints, and in his pride raged, and trampled the Holy City under his feet; now himſelf is overcome, and for madneſſe rageth, becauſe himſelf is trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115824:26"/>underfoot; before he was a raging ſpoyler, now a rager becauſe ſpoyled; and in this latter ſenſe he may be a rager, and yet the time of his Reign out; nay, that be who before trod under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot, is now trodden underfoot; who led into Captivity, is led into Captivity; who killed with the ſword, is killed with the ſword, is an evident demonſtration (though his end be not preſently, yet) that the time of his Reign and treading underfoot the Holy City is over; the Woman is got out of the Wilderneſſe; for ſhe ſeeks not now any longer holes to hide her ſelf in from the rage of her Enemy, but dares appear in his very face, and can drive her Enemy before her. Adde alſo hereunto, that although the Beaſt rage after the two and forty months are expired, yet doth not he then rage alone as he did all the two and forty months. All the two and forty months he was able to tread underfoot the Holy City, and put the Woman to flight without help; but now he is glad to call in help, ſend Ambaſſadors to the Kings of the Earth, and the whole world to ſtand by him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.13, 14. as being not able alone, though a mad raging Beaſt, to deal with a Potent Woman, which is a manifeſt Argument that the time of his Reign is over, though yet his end be not preſently; and indeed the following time is not (to ſpeak properly) the Beaſts time, ſo much as the time of Gods enemies in general, in which they all hand in hand ſhall endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Holy City, but the end ſhall be their own deſtruction, which they ſhall come to, and none ſhall help them.</p>
                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:115824:27"/>
                        <p>And here methinks it doth wonderouſly affect my heart whilſt I ponder upon it, to think how that within theſe few dayes the poor Woman will come creeping out of the Wilderneſſe, armed with ſuch courage and divine power, as that ſhe, though but a weak Woman, ſhall yet with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like reſolution flye in the very face of this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Beaſt, though all the Kings of the earth ſtand by him to help him; Un-horſe the Scarlet Whore that ſits upon him, drive the Whore, and the Beaſt that carrieth her (Antichriſts Civil and Eccleſiaſtical power) both before her, making them cry, <hi>Come help, come help, deliver us from the fury of the Woman.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>From the whole it appears what footing we have in Scripture for this diſtinction, which is a fundamental thing, as to the Enquiry in hand; Yea where it is not made, and diligently obſerved, a cloud will of neceſſity be upon all the Propheſies of the Old and New Teſtament both.</p>

                           <p>Now of theſe two, as the time of the Beaſts Reign is to expire firſt, the time of the fourth Monarchy ſome years after; So ſhall I in this
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115824:28"/>Enquiry firſt, begin with the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the time of the Beaſts Tyranny?</p>
                           <p>And ſo the Grand Queſtion is:</p>
                           <p>Queſt. <hi>When, or with what time are we to put a period to Antichriſts Tyranny.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The onely ground we have to go upon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve this great Queſtion, is, <hi>Daniels</hi> one thouſand two hundred and ninety dayes, <hi>Johns</hi> two and forty months, his one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes.</p>
                           <p>The firſt, <hi>viz. Daniels</hi> one thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ninety dayes prove not this directly; for their aime is at another thing, <hi>viz.</hi> the beginning of the <hi>Jews</hi> delivery, but by conſequence onely at the end of Antichriſts Reign, and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>Jews</hi> delivery, which fall out at a point; I ſhall therefore (having alſo ſpoken ſufficiently to that number. <hi>Key, Theſi</hi> 20.) wave it here, and wholly inſiſt upon <hi>Johns</hi> numbers of two and forty months, one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes, both which tend directly to prove the thing in hand; only with this difference; the one, <hi>viz.</hi> the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes, ſets forth the time in reference to the Churches ſuffering ſtate within this time; the other, <hi>viz.</hi> the two and forty months in reference to Antichriſts rage and tyranny throughout this time: yet both (I ſay) have a direct tendency to prove the thing, and anſwer our Queſtion. And (as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> hath excellently obſerved) Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts time is ſet forth by months, which are governed by the Moon, becauſe the worſhipping of Idols, and every ſin and error is of the power
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115824:28"/>of darkneſſe and night, wherein the Moon ruleth; but the Churches time by dayes, becauſe true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is compared to the light, and to the day, of which the Sun is the Ruler.</p>

                           <p>That both Dayes and Months are Prophetical, is clear, becauſe (as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> in his Comment upon <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. verſ. 3. well reaſons) if (ſaith he) the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes be to be underſtood of natural dayes, then are the three dayes and a half, aſſigned afterwards to the death of the Witneſſes, to be ſo underſtood alſo, they being part of the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty; but they cannot be ſo taken, becauſe the things foretold to be done within the three dayes and a half, will no way agree to three dayes and a half of natural dayes; the one therfore being Prophetical, the other muſt alſo. Withall the very things ſpoken of the Beaſt, and the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, have already taken up neer as much time as two and forty Prophetical months, one thouſand two hundred and ſixty Prophetical dayes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115824:29"/>hand, there is yet ſomething of more general concernment to be noted by the way, as,</p>
                           <p>Firſt, <hi>Let it be obſerved, that the two and forty months are twice ſpoken of.</hi> 1 Forty two months of the <hi>Beaſts continuance,</hi> Rev. 13.5. 2 Forty two months of <hi>treading underfoot the holy City,</hi> Chap. 11.2. Each two and forty months are one and the ſame in reſpect of beginning and ending. The difference between them is onely this, the firſt chiefly mentions the <hi>time allowed</hi> to the Beaſt to reign and domineer; the ſecond <hi>the work</hi> that he ſhall do within this time, <hi>viz, Tread down the Holy City.</hi> And indeed that theſe two muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin and end together, is clear; for were the tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing underfoot the Holy City to have its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning either ſome time before the riſe of the Beaſt, or ſome time after, and that as a diſtinct two and forty months from the other, then conſidering that the Beaſt muſt rage, and tyrannize two and forty months, in all which time the Holy City is trampled underfoot, the time (though ever ſo little) that we adde either before or after, will make the time of treading underfoot the Holy City to amount to more then two and forty months, which is the very time, and no longer, that the Holy City is to be trodden underfoot. <hi>The one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes, we have likewiſe twice ſpoken of.</hi> Firſt one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes of the <hi>Womans flight into the Wilderneſſe,</hi> Chap. 12.6. Secondly, one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes of the <hi>Witneſſes propheſying in Sackcloth.</hi> Chap. 11.3. Theſe two (as the other) are likewiſe one and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115824:29"/>the ſame, both for beginning and ending, the one (making mention of the ſtate of the Church more in general) ſetteth forth the place where the Church of God all the one thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty dayes ſhould abide, <hi>viz.</hi> in ſome obſcure corners of the world, as in a Wilderneſſe; the other (pointing at the ſtate of the Witneſſes in particular, which are not the whole Church, but a part onely, and this I take to be the main difference betwixt the eleven and twelve Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the <hi>Revelations</hi>) tells us, the work Chriſts Witneſſes ſhould be employed in, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this their retirement, together with the Church into blind and obſcure holes and corners, in this time of the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes, which is, they Propheſie, though in Sackcloth, <hi>i. e.</hi> in a poor oppreſſed ſorrowfull condition, through grief, to ſee all this time the Holy City trampled underfoot by the Beaſt. And indeed that theſe two alſo muſt be one and the ſame both for beginning and ending, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for the very ſame reaſon, as the former, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes of the Womans flight into the Wilderneſſe, were to begin ſooner or later then the one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred and ſixty dayes of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes propheſying in Sackcloth, then (as I ſaid of the other) ſeeing the Witneſſes wear their ſackcloth all the time the Church abides in the wilderneſſe, the added time whether before or after, would make the time of the Witneſſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying in ſackcloth to ſurmount the number of one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes.</p>
                           <pb n="26" facs="tcp:115824:30"/>
                           <p>Now in the next place it would be farther en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into, Firſt whether the two and forty months, and the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes, are a different time? or whether both make up but one and the ſame number of yeers? Secondly, whether in caſe the ſame number of yeers be found in both, are we to conceive of either as beginning and ending together? or whether is any one to begin before the other?</p>
                           <p>To the firſt, I anſwer, <hi>That we are to conceive the time to be one and the ſame in both; the two and forty mouths, the one thouſand two hundred and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty dayes making both up but one and the ſame number of years.</hi> Not to inſiſt upon what Expoſitors gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſay, that two and forty months, reckoning thirty dayes to a month, which is the <hi>Grecian</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, make up the juſt ſumme of one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes; to me it appears that the thing I am ſpeaking of muſt be ſo, and cannot be otherwiſe, and that upon the former account ſtill; becauſe were the two and forty months a time longer then the other, then the Beaſts reign and treading underfoot the Holy City, being to continue two and forty months (which two things are the main cauſe why the Woman betakes her ſelf to the Wilderneſſe, and the Witneſſes continue there with here in a mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful poſture propheſying in ſackcloath) the Womans continuance in the wilderneſſe, and the Witneſſes propheſying in ſackcloth ſhould (the cauſe ſtill remaining) be above one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes. Or were the two and forty months a ſhorter time, then ſhould the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115824:30"/>flight of the Woman into the wilderneſſe, and the Witneſſes propheſying in ſackcloth, which continues no longer then the time of the Beaſts rage, and trampling the Holy City (that being (as I have ſaid) the cauſe of the other, which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, the effect ceaſeth) not be ſo long as one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore it cannot be either a longer time, or a ſhorter, we muſt conclude one and the ſame number of years to be included in both.</p>
                           <p>To the ſecond I anſwer, <hi>That we are without doubt to conceive of it, that the two and forty months, the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes (making up but one and the ſame number of years) are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin and end together.</hi> My reaſon is ſtill what I have urged; becauſe ſhould we ſuppoſe the two and forty months to begin either ſooner or later then the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes, as a time diſtinct, and to be conſidered by it ſelf; it will then neceſſarily follow, ſeeing all the time of the Beaſts tyranny, and treading un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfoot the Holy City, the Woman is to be in the wilderneſſe, and the Witneſſes to propheſie in ſackcloth, that by reaſon of the time which muſt be addedeither before or after, to make up the two and forty months compleat, the Womans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in the wilderneſſe, and the Witneſſes propheſying in ſackcloth ſhould be above one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes.</p>
                           <p>The concluſion is, <hi>That the two and forty months, and the one thouſand two hundered and ſixty daies, are one and the ſame, and alſo begin and end to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi>

                           <p>IT being cleared in the former Chapter that both Months and dayes are Prophetical; and alſo that the two and forty months of the Beaſts continuance, the two and forty months of tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing underfoot the Holy City; the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes of the Womans abode in the wilderneſſe, the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes of the Witneſſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying in ſackcloth, do all make up but one and the ſame number of years; and alſo are one and the ſame both for beginning and ending; it comes next to be conſidered, where we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin this Epock of two and forty months, one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes.</p>
                           <p>Amongſt the variety of opinions which are extant of Writers ancient and modern, there are but three, ſave the opinion of our worthy <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Author, from whom, though I judge, by comparing myſtical numbers together, that I ſee reaſon to vary ſomewhat, yet is not the variance ſuch as deſerves a conteſt; I ſay beſides him, there are but three that have ſo much colour of reaſon for their opinions, as that there will be any need of bringing them to the Touchſtone. And theſe are,</p>
                           <p n="1">1 Thoſe who begin the Epock with the time of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great.</p>
                           <pb n="29" facs="tcp:115824:31"/>
                           <p n="2">2 A late Writer who begins with the time of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the firſt.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 Others who begin with the time when <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface</hi> was created univerſal Biſhop by <hi>Phocas.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>As for the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the opinion of thoſe who begin from the time of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great (ſome of that opinion fixing upon the year 304. others differ as to a few years, yet keep within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of 300. and 316.) I ſay not (in anſwer to it) that the very foundation of this opinion is a miſtake, <hi>viz. That the two Witneſſes are the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Old and New Teſtament.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But my reaſons againſt it are:</p>
                           <p n="1">1 Becauſe <hi>by this opinion, the Harmony of the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal numbers is deſtroyed;</hi> for if the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes, and the two and forty months begin with <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time, then is it not poſſible to bring the one thouſand two hundred &amp; ſixty dayes, the two and forty months to concur in their end with <hi>Daniels</hi> one thouſand two hundred and ninety (which muſt be upon the grounds laid down in our <hi>Key, Theſi</hi> 17.) unleſſe we ſhall finde ſome action which may be accounted a fit Head for the one thouſand two hundred and ninety daies, thirty years above <hi>Conſtantine;</hi> and in caſe this ſhould befound, yet then will not the one thouſand three hundred thirty five (which begins from the ſame Head with the one thouſand two hundred and ninety) concur in their end with the two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand three hundred (which alſo muſt be for our reaſons, <hi>Key, Theſi</hi> 34.) unleſſe ſome other begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and carrying on of that great number, may upon approved grounds be found, which will
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115824:32"/>notwithſtanding bring the two thouſand three hundred dayes to end at the ſame point with the one thouſand three hundred thirty five.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 Becauſe (ſetting the Harmony wholly aſide) <hi>by this computation the ſeventh Government in the Roman Empire,</hi> viz. <hi>by Chriſtian Emperors, which is that</hi> John <hi>calls a Government yet to come</hi> (Rev. 17.10. <hi>There are ſeven Kings</hi> (i.e. <hi>diſtinct kinds of Government</hi>) <hi>five are fallen, one is, and the other is not yet come) is either wholly cut off, or elſe confounded with the Beaſts:</hi> For this Government did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin till <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time; now if we thence alſo begin the two and forty months of the Beaſt, then do we (I ſay) leave no room for the ſeventh kind of Government; ſo that either it muſt be cut off, or confounded with the Beaſts. That it ſhould be <hi>cut off,</hi> cannot be; for the Text ſaith expreſly, <hi>it was to come,</hi> i.e. as really to have a being as the five fallen had had, and the ſixth then in being had. That we ſhould confound it with the Beaſts, may not be.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, becauſe this Government is to continue a ſpace before the riſe of the Beaſt, <hi>And when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, it muſt continue a ſhort ſpace.</hi> This ſhort ſpace muſt either be meant of the time before the Beaſts Kingdome, or the time of his Reign. If the time of his Reign be meant, and ſo the ſeventh Government, and his Reign be made one; how then is it called <hi>a ſhort ſpace?</hi> ſeeing the time allotted to the Beaſt is <hi>a long time,</hi> two and forty months; one thouſand two hundred and ſixty years; yea how is it called <hi>a ſhort ſpace</hi> comparatively with the ſixth or former Government, which continued
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115824:32"/>not half, nay not one third part of this time? this Government therefore muſt be diſtinct from the Beaſts.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, becauſe the Beaſts Government as relating to this, is called the eighth, verſ. 11. <hi>And the Beaſt that was, and is not, even he is the eighth.</hi> Though the Beaſt in reſpect of his Seat and the Civil power he exerciſeth, which power did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in all the former Governments, is ſaid to be of the ſeven; and accordingly hath ſeven Heads, <hi>i.e. Rome</hi> the Seat of, and the Civil power of all the former Governments, yet is he not called the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, but of the ſeven, becauſe ſucceſſively, and in order he followeth the ſeventh, and his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment comes in as the eighth, being a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment diſtinct from the ſeventh, and all theſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Governments before him; For which reaſon we may not confound the Beaſts Government with the ſeventh, which yet this opinion either doth, or ſhuts wholly out, neither of which can ſtand with truth.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 Becauſe <hi>according to this ſupputation, the time is expired above a hundred years ſince.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo;</p>
                           <p n="1">1 How comes it to paſſe that <hi>yet of late yeers the Holy City hath been ſo trodden underfoot?</hi> Saints for Religion ſake driven to flight, as it hath been with us here in <hi>England;</hi> yea ſo many killed, and put to death, as have been in <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>Low-Countries, France,</hi> and all this within much leſſe time then one hundred yeers, yea the greateſt part of it not half the time? Certainly whilſt the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is driven from one corner of the world to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115824:33"/>the other to hide her ſelf, and her children are cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly killed &amp; maſſacred, we cannot look upon her as come out of the wilderneſſe; whilſt Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian injunctions and ſuperſtitions are ſet up, and impoſed inſtead of the pure worſhip of Chriſt, who will ſay the treading underfoot of the Holy City is at an end? and have not theſe things been more or leſſe, within leſſe then twenty, I may ſay within leſſe then half this twenty years? I would I could not ſay at this preſent.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 How alſo comes it to paſſe that ſo many years ſince the expiring of this time, <hi>the Beaſt hath eſcaped, and neither been killed with the ſword, nor led into captivity,</hi> ſeeing it is ſaid of him that at the end of his Reign his two and forty months expired, <hi>He that leadeth into Captivity ſhall be led into Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, he that killeth with the ſword, ſhall be killed with the ſword,</hi> Rev. 13.10. If it be ſaid, Chriſt hath theſe many yeers ever ſince <hi>Luthers</hi> time in a ſpiritual manner with the ſword of his mouth been killing and captivating the Beaſt; I anſwer, true; But what hath been done againſt him by a Civil ſword, or towards a Civil captivating of him, which is the Sword and Captivity here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of? For obſerve ſuch a Sword as he hath killed the Saints with, and ſuch a Captivity as he hath expoſed them unto, ſuch a Sword, and ſuch a Captivity (it being brought upon him by God in a way of retaliation) ſhall himſelf ſuffer by, and be expoſed unto; but the one hath been Civil, therefore ſhall the other alſo. If it be replied, was not this done ſome years ſince in <hi>Germany</hi> by <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus? Anſw.</hi> Grant it ſo to be; <hi>Yet
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115824:33"/>doth that fall many years too late;</hi> the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty (according to this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) being expired long before his time; but now no ſooner is the time expired, but inſtantly, <hi>Hee that leadeth into Captivity is led into Captivity, Hee that killeth with the Sword is killed with the Sword;</hi> Neither the <hi>German</hi> War therefore, nor any that hath been ſince will at all help this opinion. 2. If the Wan of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> King in <hi>Germany</hi> were a killing the Beaſt with the Sword, a leading him <hi>into Captivity, then moſt certainly, ſince, he is riſen, and come out of Captivity again;</hi> but let us aſſure our ſelves, that when Chriſt kills the Beaſt with the Sword, he ſhall have no reſurrection; when he leades him into captivity, no return.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Obj.</hi> But it may be objected, That we muſt of neceſſity begin this Epock of one thouſand two hundred and ſixty years as high as <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> if not higher; for (<hi>Rovel.</hi> 12.) it is the Dragon with ſeven Heads, and ten Horns, and ſeven Crowns on his heads; (which is the embleme of the old <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and not the Empire of the Beaſt, who hath ten Crowns, and thoſe upon his Horns, (<hi>Revel.</hi> 13.1.) that drives the Woman into the Wilderneſs.</p>
                           <p>I anſwer; This cannot be for what hath been proved already, viz. <hi>That the forty two Months, and the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty days, are one and the ſame time, which begin and end together;</hi> and how could this be, in caſe the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty days were to begin before the riſe of the Beaſt, whilſt yet the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was ruled by the Dragon?</p>
                           <p n="2">2 Obſerve the Text it ſelf, and it will appear,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115824:34"/>
                              <hi>That the act of the Dragon there mentioned, is not the driving of the Woman into the Wilderneſs, but another thing,</hi> viz. a lying in wait to devour her childe ſo ſoon as born, v. 4. <hi>And the Dragon ſtood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her childe ſo ſoon as it was born.</hi> The meaning whereof is, That the faithful, the true members and children of the Church, (which becauſe one Body, are here repreſented by one Childe; and for dignity ſake, or elſe to repreſent their ſtrength in their head, Chriſt, a Man-childe) that in the time of Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm had been oppreſſed by the Dragon; the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel perceiving them now through <hi>Conſtantines</hi> means to be in a riſing way, and ready as with a Rod of Iron to cruſh in peices his Heatheniſh Worſhip; he therefore labours by ſtirring up the power of the old Pagan Empire to oppoſe <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi> to ſtifle this work in the beginning; but this he cannot do; <hi>Conſtantine</hi> prevails, and the faithful in deſpight of him are caught up to God, and to his Throne, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſet out of the reach of the Dragon through <hi>Conſtantines</hi> prevailing. The Church now after her ſharp fiery Trial under the Pagan Emperours coming to enjoy great peace and proſperity under <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> it comes to paſſe that ſhee abuſing her proſperity, and <hi>Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>-like now waxing fat, beginning to kick and grow wanton, her good is turned into evil, and within a ſhort time afterwards ſhee begins to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatize from her firſt Principles, and inſtead of being <hi>cloathed with the Sun</hi> (as was the Primitive Church, ver. 1.) and having the Moon under her feet, ſhe neglects the Sun, <hi>i. e.</hi> Chriſt crucified for Juſtification, and true Holineſs through his
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115824:34"/>Death and Sufferings, and arrayes her ſelf with <hi>the Moon,</hi> i.e. worldly ornaments, as Dignities, Preferments, outward Riches, &amp;c. which things a while after <hi>Conſtantine</hi> began to bee mightily ſtickled for by the Clergy generally, yea in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels alſo. Now when it came to be thus, <hi>the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> i. e. the true Church vaniſheth away, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires her ſelf into the Wilderneſs; and as ſhee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires, ſo in her room ſtands up the Beaſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> the falſe Antichriſtian Church. But this is not done inſtantly, but after the Church had had proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſome time, and abuſed it, and thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked Chriſt to with-draw his preſence and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; which gone, the Church ſtraightway dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates, and ſhee that was before the Spouſe of Chriſt, becomes an Antichriſtian Harlot.</p>
                           <p>Hence the Womans flight into the Wilderneſs is noted in the Text, as the very next thing after the childes being caught up to God and his Throne, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>And her childe was caught up to God, and to his Throne,</hi> ver. 6. <hi>And the woman fled into the Wilderneſs.</hi> Now obſerve, as the childes being caught up to God, and his Throne, was ſucceſſive to the Dragons gaping to devour the childe, which was whilſt yet the child was but in the birth; So the womans flight into the Wilderneſs (whence begins the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty days) is to be looked upon as a thing ſucceſſive, as well in time as place to the childes being caught up to God and to his Throne; And ſo the Objection is indeed a reaſon for us, that we may not begin the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty days, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> or with him, but muſt ſome time afterwards.</p>
                           <pb n="36" facs="tcp:115824:35"/>
                           <p>The Arguments brought from Hiſtory Civil, or Eccleſiaſtical, to prove this fall to the ground upon the account of theſe two reaſons.</p>
                           <p n="1">1 <hi>Becauſe Hiſtory is only a Human teſtimony, and therefore to be tried by the Divine;</hi> but the Divine teſtimony (or teſtimony of Scripture) cannot be made to agree to this beginning, as our two firſt Reaſons prove.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 Becauſe <hi>all that is ſaid from Hiſtory,</hi> as <hi>viz.</hi> the Story of <hi>Conſtantines</hi> donation of <hi>Rome, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> &amp;c. to Pope <hi>Silvester,</hi> the ſtory of Queen <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens</hi> Croſſe, &amp;c. <hi>have only the authority of Popiſh Writers, and not any of the Ancients to countenance them;</hi> yea, are exploded by Proteſtant Writers as Fables; as ſee <hi>Melancthon</hi> in his review of <hi>Carions</hi> Chronicle, lib. 3. <hi>Johan. Wolf.</hi> cent. 4. <hi>Simpſons</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Church, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cent.</hi> 4.</p>
                           <p>The Argument urged by ſome from the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions (which of all Arguments from meer Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is the moſt plauſible) tends only to prove that the Papiſts reckon the beginning of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from about this time. But doth it follow that therefore we are ſo to do? What Scripture warrant is there for ſuch a thing, that there wee ſhould begin the time of the Beaſts reign, where the Beaſts own followers begin their Kingdome? Certainly, were this a rule to walk by, there would be no difficulty at all in making up our account of the forty two Moneths, &amp; the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty days; yea take it at beſt, it is but an uncertain Argument; for ſome end the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiads, and begin the Indictions ſooner, ſome later; and what ſtrength this Argument hath in it (which in my account is but feeble) will as wel
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115824:35"/>agree (according to ſome) to a more likely time, as to this; for <hi>Roſſe</hi> in his Hiſtory of the World ſaith, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. that about the year three hundred ninety five the Olympiads ceaſed, and the Indictions were inſtituted.</p>
                           <p>The concluſion of all is, <hi>That that opinion which begins the forty two Moneths, and the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty days with</hi> Conſtantine, <hi>is not that we are to cleave unto, as truth in this thing.</hi>

                           <p>The Authors calculation of the time when the Beaſt ſhall begin to go to wrack, and that from the number of his Name, ſix hundred ſixty ſix, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries not weight with me, becauſe I finde the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Beaſts name put for a part or peece of the Beaſts Idolatry, which the true worſhippers of Jeſus are to ſhun, and get victory over, <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.2. <hi>And I ſaw them that had gotten the victory over the Beaſt, and over his Image, and over his Mark, and over the number of his Name.</hi> But now did the number of his Name hold forth the time of his continuance, it would contrariwiſe bee a great part of a Saints comfort and joy to know it.</p>
                           <p>Nay further, I finde the Papals ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by God for having to do with this Name, Chap. 14.11. <hi>And the ſmoak of their torment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendeth up for ever and ever. And they have no reſt day nor night, who worſhip the Beaſt, and his image, and whoſoever receiveth the mark of his name.</hi> The leaſt that can be inferred from theſe words, is, that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115824:36"/>the mark of the Beaſt and his name are things of neer kin the one to the other; therefore his mark, and the number of his name are both included in theſe words, The mark of his name. But were there any ſuch thing intended in the number of the Beaſts name, as the time of his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, this could not be, but contrariwiſe, the Beaſts mark, and the number of his name ſhould be things vaſtly different. To ſay the one and the other may be intended, cannot be, unleſſe we ſhould ſuppoſe contraries, <hi>viz.</hi> Sin and Comfort, a Curſe and a Bleſſing may be reconciled.</p>
                           <p>The concluſion is, <hi>That that opinion, which makes the two and forty months, the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes to begin</hi> A. D. 442. <hi>cannot be the minde of the Holy Ghoſt in this thing.</hi>

                           <p>There is yet another opinion, which begins the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes with the time when <hi>Boniface</hi> was by <hi>Phocas</hi> made uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Biſhop.

                           <p>But this cannot be:</p>
                           <p n="1">1 <hi>Becauſe all the wit of man can never according to this opinion bring forth a Harmony of the myſtical Numbers,</hi> i. e. make the one thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty dayes to end at the ſame point with the one thouſand two hundred and ninety, and the one thouſand three hundred thirty and five with the two thouſand three hundred, both which muſt be.</p>

                           <p>The Concluſion is, <hi>That we are not to begin the two and forty months, or the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes, with the time when</hi> Boniface <hi>was created univerſal Biſhop by</hi> Phocas.</p>

                           <p>IT will now be ſaid, ſeeing I diſallow all the precedent accounts, <hi>What year do I my ſelf pitch upon for the beginning of this Epock.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I anſwer, The year I fixe upon, I have already ſtated in my <hi>Key,</hi> to be <hi>A.D.</hi> 396.</p>
                           <p>The Reaſons of this fixation are,</p>
                           <p n="1">1 Reaſon, <hi>Becauſe that year, and no other can make the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes concur in their end with the one thouſand two hundred and ninety;</hi> And alſo the one thouſand three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thirty five with the two thouſand and three hundred.</p>

                           </p>
                           <p>Out of which words I draw this Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>That the Revelation of the man of Sin was then to be, when as there ſhould appear ſome eminent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the Church from its primitive purity:</hi> For the Apoſtle makes the falling away, to be the Revelation of the man of ſin; as to ſay, the man of ſin ſhall then thruſt himſelf into the world, in, or with this falling away.</p>
                           <pb n="42" facs="tcp:115824:38"/>
                           <p>Now let us enquire when this eminent Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy from Primitive purity began, and therein undoubtedly are we to ſtate the riſe of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Beaſt.</p>
                           <p>Much as to this I have written already, <hi>Key, Theſi</hi> 23. ſo as that it may ſeem ſuperfluous to adde any thing more. All therefore that I ſhall do farther, ſhall be onely to tranſlate ſome few things of many, which I finde gathered together out of the Ancients by <hi>Joan. Wolfius</hi> in his Cente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, who applyes things to the particular year or time of their riſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> when a diſcovery was firſt made of theſe corruptions, and witneſſe born againſt them, by good men living in thoſe firſt ages.</p>
                           <p>And firſt as for what is by him laid down in his Epiſtle Dedicatory,</p>
                           <p>Out of <hi>Jerome</hi> he hath theſe ſayings, which he applies to the year 390.</p>
                           <p>Concerning the Avarice and corruption of the Clergy, <hi>Jerome</hi> thus;</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Whence is this Avarice crept into the Church? the Law now periſheth from the Prieſt, the Viſion from the Prophet.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>And again, Searching</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>former Hiſtories, I have not been able to find any who have ſo rent the Church, and ſeduced thoſe of Gods Family, as thoſe do who now go under the name of Prieſts; they are become a crooked ſnare, giving occaſion to ſcandal in all places.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Farther, He calls the then Roman Presbytery, Scribes, Phariſees, <hi>a Synod of Phariſees;</hi> and addes, that from <hi>the Apoſtles dayes untill that time the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115824:38"/>Church grew under Perſecutions, and was crowned with Martyrdome;</hi> But (ſaith he) <hi>at this day the ſame is greater in riches, and power, but leſſe in vertue.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Concerning the Prohibition of Mariage Meats, &amp;c. the ſaid <hi>Jerome,</hi> thus;</p>
                           <p>IN HYPOCRYSIE <hi>they ſpeak, who when they cannot contain, will ſeem ſo chaſte as even to condemn Mariage, ſo abſtemious that they judge thoſe that uſe the creatures of God ſparingly, when as they give up themſelves to follow luxurious Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Our aforeſaid Author alleadgeth alſo a ſaying out of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> applying it to the year 399. tending to ſhew how greatly the Church about this time was fallen from her firſt purity. The teſtimony ſpeaks thus, <hi>That Religion about this time was ſo corrupted with Traditions and humane Rites, that the very condition of the Jews under the Law was more eaſie then that of Chriſtians under the Goſpel.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Alſo under the very ſame year (as the next thing) he brings a teſtimony of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Corinth,</hi> who by an Epiſtle admoniſheth another Biſhop, <hi>that he ſhould not load Chriſtians with heavy Burdens, Ceremonies and Traditions, nor obtrude upon his Brethren ſingle life.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>After this he quotes <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> declaming againſt the <hi>Biſhop of Romes Purgatory,</hi> &amp;c. which things he applies to the year 410. the recital whereof I forbear to mention.</p>
                           <p>Hitherto of what I find in our Authors Epiſtle.</p>
                           <p>The Book it ſelf affords variety of the like,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115824:39"/>betwixt the years 390 and 400, whereof I ſhall onely glean up ſome things.</p>

                           <p>Of the Clergies enriching themſelves by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular Confeſſion, he ſaith thus,</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>That when any Prince or great man confeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf guilty of any crime by him committed, preſently by threats and perſwaſions he was made to beleeve that he could not be ſaved, unleſſe he did confer on the Church a good part of his eſtate; or elſe bidding farewel to all earthly things, devolving them upon the Clergy, ſhould betake himſelf to a private Monkiſh life; which done, he ſhould thereby not onely be freed from Hell, but alſo obtain a ſure certain and plentiful hope of life eternal.</hi>
                           </p>

                              <hi>A.D.</hi> 393. He ſaith thus, <hi>That in that very year was ſeen hanging in the Heavens, a burning Pillar by the ſpace of thirty dayes.</hi> And (ſaith he) <hi>about this very time began humane Traditions, Monkiſh life, &amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>A.D.</hi> 395. He makes mention of one <hi>Amphilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Iconium, reprehending the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Images;</hi> An Argument Image worſhip was up ſo early.</p>

                              <hi>A. D.</hi> 396. He collects many things out of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> third Book, <hi>Contra Haereſes,</hi> ſhewing how great the <hi>defection was at this time.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Concerning Image worſhip, <hi>Epiphanius</hi> thus.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Whence is this Image worſhip, and deſign of the Devil?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And a little after, <hi>The Images of ſuch as never lived, do men introduce to be worſhipped, having the mind adulterated from the one, and only God.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <pb n="45" facs="tcp:115824:39"/>
                           <p>And a little after that, <hi>Be mindful my beloved children, that ye bring not Images into the Church, but bear about God alwayes in your hearts; for it is not meet that a Chriſtian ſhould be held by his eyes, but by the occupation of his mind.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Concerning the Virgin <hi>Mary, Epiphanius</hi> thus;</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>The body of</hi> Mary <hi>was truly holy, but not God. The Virgin her ſelf was indeed a Virgin, and to be honoured, but not given us that we ſhould worſhip her, ſhe her ſelf worſhipping him who was born of her fleſh.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Much more is by the aforeſaid Author quoted from <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> which ſpeaks the very ſame language with theſe, all which he applyes to the year 396. the recital whereof I forbear.</p>

                           <p>Concerning Purgatory, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> thus,</p>

                              <hi>The Catholick faith beleeves Heaven to be the firſt place; the ſecond Hell; as for a third, we are wholly ignorant, nor is it found in the Scripture.</hi>

                              <hi>It is not our Religion to worſhip dead men; they are honored for our imitation ſake, not to be worſhipped for the ſake of Religion, nor are we to conſecrate Temples to them, for they will not ſo be honoured of us.</hi>

                           <p>

                              <hi>We who are called Chriſtians do not beleeve in</hi> Peter, <hi>but in whom</hi> Peter <hi>did beleeve.</hi> And again, <hi>The Keyes of the Church are delivered to the whole Church, not to one</hi> Peter.</p>
                           <p>A little after, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> reprehending (ſaith our Author) the arrogancy of the Popes who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered themſelves to be called Gods, ſaith, <hi>He that would ſeem to be God, when as he is man, doth not imitate him, who when he was God, was for our ſakes made man.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The aforeſaid Author quoteth a ſaying of <hi>Gregory Nazianzene</hi> concerning Councels about this time, <hi>Cent.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 127. <hi>If truth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be ſpoken, I judge it beſt that all Councels be avoyded; for I never ſaw good end of any Councel, nor the abrogation of any evill thereby, but only ambition, contention, and ſtrifes about Prerogative and Dignity.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This cloud of witneſſes ſtanding up for the truth, and that about this time is a manifeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of <hi>that great Apoſtacy from primitive principles and purity, which we are ſpeaking of, to be about this very time.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>If any doubt of the Teſtimonies themſelves, or conceive I may in tranſlating them have corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, they may ſatisfie themſelves by having recourſe to my Author; where likewiſe they ſhall find in moſt things, two for one of what I have tranſlated.</p>
                           <p>Adde hereto as a Celeſtial ſign of this defection, and of the riſe of the Antichriſtian <hi>Lucifer</hi> about this very time, what is by <hi>Alſted</hi> recorded, <hi>viz. That a little before this time, as namely, A. D.</hi> 383. And again, <hi>A. D.</hi> 389. <hi>were ſeen two Comets,

                           <p>Yet as concerning the defection I am ſpeaking of, I grant that the ſame was in <hi>part more early.</hi> The reaſon whereof is this, <hi>becauſe the myſtery of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity from the Apoſtles dayes did begin to work,</hi> and endeavour to thruſt it ſelf in, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.7.</p>

                           <p>So alſo in the year 326. It was endeavoured in the Councel of <hi>Nice, That Biſhops and Elders ſhould refrain from their wives:</hi> But <hi>Paphnutius</hi> oppoſed himſelf to the whole Councel, urging that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Mariage is honourable among all men,</hi> and ſo far prevailed as to bring forth a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of liberty, that for chaſtity ſake ſuch might accompany with their wives. <hi>Alſted</hi> in <hi>Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia teſtium veritatis.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But now though Antichriſt was more early thruſting himſelf forth, yet are we not thence to reckon his riſe, but from that time when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy grew eminent, the Councels, and Miniſtry being more generally corrupted, which was about the aforeſaid year, 396.</p>
                           <p>And certainly if at this time after all theſe things before mentioned were come forth, we cannot yet ſee the Beaſt in the world, but muſt come down lower to find him, it argues that we either ſhut our eyes, or are blind whilſt we look for him.</p>

                           <p>The Argument then lies thus, <hi>If that falling away which is foretold ſhould be at the time of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts Revelation, were</hi> A.D. 396. <hi>then are we there to place the Beaſts riſe, and accordingly thence to reckon the two and forty months, and the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes; but the Antecedent is true; therefore the conſequent.</hi>

                           </p>
                           <p n="1">1 Whether this taking away be to be reckoned from the time that the Civil power of the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115824:41"/>Roman Empire was wholly taken off the ſeventh Head, and fixed ſome where elſe, or whether from the time when this began to be?</p>
                           <p n="2">2 In caſe we incline to the one, or the other, what time are we to pitch upon, in which this was done?</p>
                           <p>Concerning the firſt, <hi>We are</hi> (as I conceive) <hi>to account from that time when this began to be done.</hi> My Reaſons are,</p>
                           <p n="1">1 Becauſe it is proper and agreeable to the phraſe of taking away, to ſay a thing is then taken away when as ſuch a beginning is made as irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtably cauſeth a total removing or taking away.</p>
                           <p>It is ſaid, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.2. <hi>That ſeventy yeers were to be accompliſhed in the deſolations of Jeruſalem.</hi> Theſe ſeventy yeers are to bee reckoned from the firſt Captivity, which was in the third yeer of <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> Dan. 1.1, 2. 2 Chon. 36.6, 7. as is clear,</p>
                           <p n="1">1 Becauſe the Scriptures ſpeaking of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty years Captivity point us to <hi>Jehoiakims</hi> reign, as the time from whence we are to begin our account, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 25. verſ. 1. compared with verſ. 11, 12. Chap. 29. verſ. 1, 2. compared with verſ. 10.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 Becauſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> was to ſerve the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> but ſeventy years, <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.11, 12. <hi>Theſe Nations ſhall ſerve the King of Babylon ſeventy years. And after ſeventy years are accompliſhed, I will puniſh the King of Babylon.</hi> Now <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude to the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> beginning in the

                           <p n="3">3 Becauſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> was to be in <hi>Babylon</hi> but the terme of ſeventy years, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.10. <hi>For thus ſaith the Lord, that after ſeventy years be accompliſhed, I will viſit you, and perform my good word towards you, in cauſing you to return to this place.</hi> But <hi>Iſrael</hi> for a conſiderable part of them were carried into <hi>Babylon</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Jehoiakim;</hi> if therefore we begin the ſeventy years afterwards, then ſeeing that untill the ſeventy years were expired, they came not out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> their being in <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhould be upwards of ſeventy yeers; therefore I ſay that the ſeventy yeers of <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are to reckoned from the firſt Captivity; yet obſerve, their deſolations then were onely begun, not perfected till nineteen years after, in the eleventh of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> when City and Temple were deſtroyed, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.19. yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding doth the Holy Ghoſt reckon their deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and captivity from the time the ſame was begun, though the compleating of it was not till ſome yeers after.</p>
                           <p>So <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.26. Its ſaid concerning the little Horn, <hi>the judgement ſhall ſit, and they ſhall take away his Dominion:</hi> And when is this taking away? <hi>Anſ. When the Ancient of dayes begins to ſit, and the Thrones of the Beaſt begin to be caſt down,</hi> though yet the final deſtruction of this little H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>rn is not till afterwards, verſ. 11. And obſerve, if the ruine of the Roman Empire in its ſecond ſtate under Antichriſt be to be reckoned from the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115824:42"/>time when this begins, why not in its firſt likewiſe?</p>
                           <p>In Scripture Phraſe therefore a thing is ſaid to be taken away, when the deſolating and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving time is come, and the work begun, though yet the compleating of it be not till ſome time after.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 Becauſe the Beaſt did not take up and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe all the Civil power of the Roman Empire together, or at once, but did by little and little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſe the ſame into his own hands, as the ſame by degrees fell off the ſeventh Head. And if ſo, then of neceſſity muſt the Beaſt, who pills the ſeventh Head, and robs him of his power, have a being before as yet the ſeventh Head had loſt all his power, or was totally deſtroyed.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 Becauſe if we begin not till this work was compleated, then of neceſſity muſt we extend the forty months, the one thouſand two-hundred and ſixty dayes, beyond <hi>Daniels</hi> two thouſand three hundred, and his one thouſand three hundred thirty five, both which expire <hi>A.D.</hi> 1701. but ſo will not the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes, if we find not a beginning for them till the compleat devaſtation of the ancient Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire.</p>
                           <p>To ſay ſome middle beginning may be found, muſt be grounded upon ſome ſuch ſubſtantial reaſon as may enervate the force of ours; and withall be ſo carried on, as that the admirable Harmony betwixt <hi>Daniels</hi> numbers and <hi>Johns</hi> may be preſerved.</p>
                           <p>The concluſion therefore is, That we are not to reckon this taking away from the time that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115824:43"/>the Civil power of the Roman Empire was fully removed from the ſeventh Head, but rather from the time when this began.</p>
                           <p>Our next Queſtion is, What time are we to pitch upon when this was done?</p>

                           <p n="2">2 Becauſe <hi>about this very time did the Goths and Vandals invade the Roman Empire, coming in as an overflowing deluge upon divers parts of the Roman Empire.</hi> A better teſtimony hereof I cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, then by transferring hither what by the learned <hi>Mede</hi> is gathered together out of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients relating to this time and thing, in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> Chap. 8. upon the firſt Trumpet.</p>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115824:45"/>began to be a removall of the Civil power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from the Head to the Horns; ſo is it alſo as clear an Argument that the Beaſt was now ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; for it is the Beaſts Horns that have Crowns upon them, the Dragons have none. But of this more in my next.</p>
                           <p>From the whole I frame this Argument; <hi>The forty two Months, and the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty days are there to begin where the Civil pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire began to go to decay, or to be taken away. But this was</hi> Anno Dom. <hi>three hundred ninety ſix.</hi> Ergo.</p>

Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi> in his <hi>Perſonal Reign,</hi> p. 44. ſaith, That about the year four hundred, or four hundred and ſix, ſome of the ten Kingdoms in Europe began to riſe.

                           <p>Mr. <hi>Medes</hi> own opinion is, That all the ten Horns were in being in the year four hundred fifty ſix, the Empire in that year appearing divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ten Kingdoms, which together with the names of the People, and of the Kings, and Provinces over which they reigned, are by him laid down in this following Table, <hi>Cl. p.</hi> 80.</p>

                           <p>Now to make our Argument the more firm, let it be obſerved, <hi>That we are to place the riſe of the Beaſt before the riſe of the Horns;</hi> the Horns there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having being, ſome ſo early as the years four hundred, four hundred and three, four hundred and ſix, &amp;c. yea being compleat, having their perfect number, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> four hundred fifty ſix, the riſe of the Beaſt muſt be placed ſomewhat more early; and therefore it is not amiſſe that I have pitched upon the year three hundred nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſix.</p>
                           <p>Now that the riſe of the Beaſt muſt be before the riſe of the Horns, is evident;</p>
                           <p n="1">1 <hi>Becauſe the ten Horns with Crowns upon them are the Horns of the Antichriſtian Beaſt, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> This being ſo, the Antichriſtian Beaſt muſt neceſſarily be before his Horns; for how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, yea abſurd would it bee to ſay, That Horns ſhould grow before, or without a Beaſt? To ſay, The Horns are the ſame which were grown before, only the Beaſt puts Crowns upon them, which before they had not, helps not the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:115824:47"/>thing, for if the Beaſt crown the Horns, then is he before any of the Horns are crowned; that which is not, cannot adde to another thing.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 <hi>Becauſe the riſe of the Beast is to bee reckoned from that point of time, in which the Civil power of the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire began to be taken away, as hath been proved already;</hi> but now none of the Crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Horns ariſe till a while after, the Horns get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Crowns, i.e. a Civil power to themſelves, by the devaſtation of the ſeventh Head, i. e. pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Empire of its Civil power.</p>

                           <p>Two other opinions there are embraced at this day by men of great light, learning, and worth, whom I would not thwart, were it not but that this Prophecy of <hi>Daniels</hi> little Horn is ſo materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that an error here turns the ſtreams of all <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels</hi> Prophecies out of their proper channel; and becauſe the beſt men, and men of greateſt Light may have their particular miſtakes, I hope it will not be grievous or offenſive to any, if for truths ſake I bring the principles of thoſe, whoſe light in other things I eſteem above my own, as to this particular thing, to the touch-ſtone.</p>

                           <p>Theſe two Principles are ſo clear and unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable upon the grounds, that not my ſelf on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but alſo thoſe good men go, from whom yet (as to their opinions of the little Horn) I vary, yea from the plain ſcope and expreſſions of each Prophecy, that to inſiſt upon particular proof, were but to multiply words.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 <hi>That the Fourth or</hi> Roman <hi>Monarchy conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of two States;</hi> 1 A pure Civil State, 2 A mixt State, partly Civil, partly Eccleſiaſtical; <hi>hath therefore in each of</hi> Daniels <hi>Viſions and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies a two-fold repreſentation ſuitable to its two-fold ſtate.</hi> In that of the Great Image, the <hi>Roman</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy (which is ſignified by the leggs and feet of that Image) is firſt repreſented as a pure Civil State, by the <hi>leggs of Iron,</hi> breaking in peeces and ſubduing all things, verſ. 40. as a mixt State, by the feet and toes of the Image, which are <hi>part of Iron, part of Potters clay,</hi> ver. 41.</p>
                           <p>In the ſecond Viſion of the fourth Beaſt, the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, ſignified by the fourth Beaſt, is repreſented in two States. 1 As a Civil State, and ſo it is a Beaſt dreadfull, terrible, ſtrong ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, having great Iron teeth, devouring and breaking in peeces, verſ. 7.2. As a mixt State, and ſo a raging blaſphemous little Horn, ver. 8.21.25.</p>
                           <p>In the third, chap 8. the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by the little Horn, verſ. 9.) hath two States; 1 A Civil State, and ſo it is a little Horn waxing great in a way of conqueſt, ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nations to it ſelf, verſ. 9. 2 A mixt State,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:115824:48"/>and ſo it is a little Horn, waxing great in a way of oppoſition to the truths, people, and worſhip of God, ver. 10, 11, 12.24, 25.</p>
                           <p>In the fourth and laſt Prophecy, the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy hath two States; 1 A Civil State, and ſo it is that terrible potent King of the North, chap. 11. verſ. 14. to 21. 2 A mixt State, and ſo it is that vile Perſon, verſ. 21. whoſe deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and acts are continued to ver. 40.</p>
                           <p>This I take to be (and I doubt not but he who thorowly weighs each Prophecy will, yea muſt in this be of my minde) the true ſtate of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, as the ſame is ſet forth in all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of <hi>Daniel.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Hence fourthly, It follows upon the former, That the little Horn, chap 7. ſignifying the mixt State of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, and the mixt State of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy being alſo the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied chap. 2. by the feet and toes of the great I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, chap. 8. by the little Horn there mentioned in his ſecond waxing great, chap. 11. by the vile Perſon; Hence I ſay, it follows, <hi>That the feet and toes of the great Image,</hi> chap. 2. <hi>the little Horn,</hi> ch. 7. <hi>the little Horn in its ſecond waxing great.</hi> chap. 8. <hi>and the vile perſon</hi> cha. 11. <hi>are all one and the ſame thing.</hi> What therefore is affirmed of the little Horn, <hi>chap.</hi> 7. muſt bee of all the reſt.</p>
                           <p>This premiſed, I come now to the opinions themſelves.</p>
                           <p>The firſt opinion is that which interprets this little Horn of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> at leaſt-wiſe as to the ſpecial accommodation. The rage of this little Horn againſt the Saints to be ſpecially meant of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:115824:49"/>the Turks Tyranny over, and oppreſſion of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But this opinion cannot I receive, becauſe it ſeems to me to be <hi>inconſiſtent with all the four fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Propheſies.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="1">1 for the Propheſie <hi>of the great Image,</hi> its inconſiſtent with that; for the feet of the great Image (the ſame with the little Horn) are to be underſtood of ſuch a power, as Firſt, is made up of a mixture, and that of things contrary, as iron and clay. Secondly, it is ſuch a power as conſiſts of ten parts, which ten parts are repreſented by the ten Toes, verſ. 42. Now neither of theſe Characters either do, or will agree to the Empire of the Great Turk, but both are punctually ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in the Kingdome of Antichriſt, which firſt is made up of a Civil and Eccleſiaſtical power moulded together; ſecondly, conſiſts of ten Horns <hi>i.e.</hi> ſo many Kingdomes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.12.16.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 For the Propheſie Chap. 8. <hi>The proud He,</hi> there ſpoken of (who is the ſame with this little Horn) is ſaid to caſt down <hi>ſome of the hoſt of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and of the ſtars to the ground, and to ſtamp upon them,</hi> verſ. 10. <hi>to take away the daily ſacrifice, throw down the place of his Sanctuary, caſt down the truth to the ground,</hi> verſ. 11.12. Yea, he is alſo ſaid to <hi>underſtand dark ſentences,</hi> verſ. 23. <hi>to be mighty, but not by his own power, to deſtroy wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, to deſtroy the mighty and holy people,</hi> verſ. 24.</p>
                           <p>None of theſe Characters (which are all the Characters of the little Horn) either will, or can agree to any act of the Turk put forth towards the <hi>Jews,</hi> for,</p>
                           <pb n="65" facs="tcp:115824:49"/>
                           <p n="1">1 The <hi>Jews</hi> in the ſtate they are in, and have been in theſe many years, cannot be called <hi>The Hoſt of Heaven, i. e.</hi> The true worſhippers of God, as the phraſe ſignifies.</p>
                           <p>Neither ſecondly, can the caſting down and trampling the <hi>Jews</hi> be called <hi>A caſting down of ſtars, and trampling upon them.</hi> The Officers of the Chriſtian Churches are called Stars, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.20. <hi>The ſeven Stars are the Angels of the ſeven Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;</hi> but where in any Propheſie relating to the Church of the New Teſtament, from the day the <hi>Jews</hi> were broken off, till this day, are the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors and Rabbins called Stars?</p>
                           <p>Neither thirdly, can the Turks ſitting over the material Temple, <hi>viz.</hi> the place of it at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> be in a true ſenſe called the <hi>taking away of the daily ſacrifice, and a throwing down the place of his San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary.</hi> If it be ſaid, by ſitting there, he hinders men from embracing the Meſſiah, ſo he doth by ſitting in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and therefore his ſitting there may as properly in that ſenſe (though <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> were not under his power) be called a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of the dayly ſacrifice, and caſting down the place of Gods Sanctuary.</p>
                           <p>Neither fourthly, can his oppoſing the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical worſhip be termed a <hi>casting down the truth to the ground,</hi> ſeeing God hath caſt down that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and owns it for his truth no longer.</p>
                           <p>Neither fifthly, will it agree to <hi>Mahomet</hi> to entitle him a King <hi>underſtanding dark ſentences,</hi> whoſe birth and education was poor and mean, and ſo far was he from learning and high ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations (which Antichriſt not onely pretends to,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:115824:50"/>but is alſo furniſhed with) as that indeed he had nothing leſſe.</p>
                           <p>Neither ſixthly, doth it agree to the Turk to term him <hi>mighty, but not by his own power;</hi> ſeeing his might lies in no other power but his own; but it is an excellent deſcription of the Romiſh Antichriſt, who whilſt he would make the world beleeve that he is Chriſts Vicar, and a ſpiritual creature, doth yet lift up and exerciſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes mighty thereby, a Civil ſword, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he hath nothing to do with.</p>
                           <p>Neither ſeventhly, can it be ſaid of the Turk that he hath <hi>deſtroyed wonderfully, i.e.</hi> more then any before him; and this wonderful deſtruction, to be a deſtruction of the mighty and holy people; ſeeing it is a thing rare with the Turk upon a meer account of Religion (what to increaſe his Empire he hath done, is but what others have done) to deſtroy men. But now what the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Antichriſt in this kind hath done, is notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly known. If it be ſaid, he hath deſtroyed by the poyſon of his Religion more then ever any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
                           <p>Its anſwered, but not the holy people, the holy people are kept by God, and therefore ſafe from the inchantments of Satan. To underſtand it of the Jews, will neither agree to them, either in the ſtate they were in, when <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaw this Viſion, nor the ſtate they are in at preſent. Not the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, becauſe then they were not the mighty people; for they were a people in Captivity; not the latter, becauſe now they are not the holy people, being a people as yet rejected of God.</p>
                           <pb n="67" facs="tcp:115824:50"/>
                           <p n="3">3 For the Propheſie Chap. 11. <hi>The vile per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> (the ſame with the little Horn) is ſaid to have <hi>indignation againſt the holy Covenant,</hi> verſ. 30. to cauſe <hi>the underſtanding people, who ſhall inſtruct many, to fall by the ſword, the flame, by captivity and ſpoyl many dayes,</hi> verſ. 33. The following Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ractors of this King, I ſhall take up, and ſhew whoſe they are, in anſwering the other opinion of this little Horn.</p>
                           <p>As for theſe two we have named, how will they, or can they agree to the Turk.</p>
                           <p n="1">1 What <hi>holy Covenant</hi> is that which he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt? If the Levitical Covenant, God owns not that for the Holy Covenant any longer; but put caſe he did, what particular indignation doth the Turk expreſſe againſt that Covenant, when as a great part of his Religion is founded upon it? If the Goſpel-Covenant, then muſt this indignation of his be not againſt <hi>Jews,</hi> but Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; for they are the children of this Covenant; and if ſo, then are we off of our Argument, and we muſt rather of the two conclude the Romiſh Antichriſt to be this vile perſon, then the Turk; for he, and not the Turk, is the great and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal oppreſſor of theſe.</p>
                           <p>As for the ſecond, what <hi>underſtanding people</hi> are they who are ſaid to inſtruct many, that through ſword, flame, captivity, and ſpoyl, fall by the hand of the Turk? Can they be the <hi>Jews</hi> as ſuch? None will ſay ſo. Are they Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians? then are theſe things in a more eſpecial manner to bee applyed to the Romiſh Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt than the Turk; for the underſtanding
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115824:51"/>people who have been the inſtructers of many, have fallen ten to one, I might ſay a hundred to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                              </gap>e, more by his hand then ever have fallen by the hand of the Turk. Nay when did ever yet the Turk make a war upon, raiſe a perſecution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>underſtanding people</hi> meerly upon this account becauſe they were ſuch? But this hath been the practice of the Romiſh Antichriſt throughout all ages.</p>
                           <p n="4">4 For the Propheſie it ſelf, Chap. 7. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the little Horn <hi>agrees not to it,</hi> neither to the Characters of the little Horn menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in it, nor to the time of his continuance.</p>
                           <p n="1">1 Not to <hi>the Characters,</hi> the little Horn is ſaid, <hi>to make war with the Saints of the moſt High,</hi> verſ. 21. to <hi>wear out the Saints of the moſt High,</hi> verſ. 25. How doth he wear them out?</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſw.</hi> Partly by inward grief to hear his blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, partly by outward ſufferings, perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, martyrdomes.</p>
                           <p>But now as to the firſt, The Turkiſh oppreſſion of the <hi>Jews</hi> by detaining their land from them (which he hath done divers hundred years) cannot be called a making war with the Saints of the moſt High; for the <hi>Jews</hi> from the day he firſt had their land to this, have been a people rejected by God, and therefore cannot in the condition they are in, and have ſtood in a long time, be conſidered as the Saints of the moſt High.</p>
                           <p>As for the ſecond, The Turk cannot be ſaid in either of the forementioned reſpects, to wear out the <hi>Jews;</hi> For firſt, They grieve not, nor (as yet) are their ſouls worn out to hear his blaſphemies. Secondly, They have not been by him perſecuted
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115824:51"/>and martyred for Religion ſake meerly, but are owned and countenanced in his Dominions.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 Not to the <hi>expreſſions uſed by the Holy Ghoſt to ſet forth the time of his continuance;</hi> For the time of his continuance is expreſſed by a <hi>time, times, and dividing of time,</hi> verſ. 25. which words being ſpoken in the <hi>Gentile</hi> Dialect, and ſignifying the very time of the black day of the <hi>Gentile</hi> Churches, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.14. ſeems to me clearly to argue, that this little Horn is ſuch a one as ſhould Tyrannize over the <hi>Gentile</hi> Churches, not the <hi>Jews;</hi> and this agrees not to the <hi>Turk,</hi> but the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Antichriſt.</p>
                           <p>So that we ſee that this interpretation will not agree to any one of all <hi>Daniels</hi> Propheſies.</p>
                           <p>Yet here let me ſay, that thus far I go up with the Aſſertors of this opinion, as to beleeve, that the Propheſies of the Old Teſtament, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the glorious reſtitution of the Church, do more directly and immediately look towards the <hi>Jews;</hi> yet with this <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that this rule is appliable to ſuch Propheſies only as relate to the time of the <hi>Jews</hi> coming in: But now this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of <hi>Daniels</hi> little Horn, and his blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, his rage againſt the Saints, relate to another time, namely that time in which the <hi>Jews</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; for the coming in of the <hi>Jews</hi> is not till the end of the time, times, and a half, which is the time where the little Horns dominion ceaſeth. It therefore follows, that all the time of the little Horns blaſphemy and tyranny, the <hi>Jews</hi> are a people rejected, and are not received till the day where a period is put to his reign; therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115824:52"/>Propheſies that relate to the time of their reſtitution have a look firſtly to that people, yet not this Propheſie, which relates to the time of their rejection.</p>
                           <p>But indeed our Rule in <hi>Daniels</hi> Propheſies muſt be this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the ſcope of the Holy Ghoſt in <hi>Daniel</hi> is to repreſent the ſtate of things in the world from <hi>Daniels</hi> time to the end, with a ſpecial reference ſtill to Gods Church and people in it. This being ſo, it follows that ſo long as the <hi>Jews</hi> remained a Church, ſo long did the things foretold primarily reſpect them; when they are broken off, and the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Gods choſen people, throughout that period, do the things foretold primarily reſpect the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> when the <hi>Jews</hi> are grafted in again, then ſhall the things, as at firſt, ſo now again, be primarily fulfilled to them. So that (I ſay) although Propheſies which relate to the time of the <hi>Jews</hi> coming in do primarily look to that people, yet is the caſe otherwiſe as to thoſe Propheſies which relate to the times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt their breaking off, and their receiving again.</p>
                           <p>And although the name Antichriſt is appliable all the time of the <hi>Jews</hi> rejection to none but the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Antichriſt, the only Perſecutor of the <hi>Gentile</hi> Saints; yet this I readily grant, if we ſpeak of the time after the <hi>Jews</hi> come in, that the name Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt ſhall be as well, and as properly appliable at that time to the <hi>Turk,</hi> as to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Antichriſt (which conſideration affords anſwer as to all thoſe agreements (ſome make) betwixt <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Turk</hi>) and this ſeems to me to be the great
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115824:52"/>and only thing intended, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. verſ. 40. to the end, which place I ſhall a little open, chiefly to let light into that Propheſie, which (in my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion) is generally miſtaken.</p>
                           <p>The great knot of that Propheſie, is, <hi>Whom we are to underſtand by the King of the North, and who by the King of the South.</hi> Now for the untying hereof, we are to conſider, that theſe titles the <hi>King of the North, and the King of the South, are not appliable to two parties or people only, but to divers parties and people;</hi> For this Chapter carries us through the ſecond, third, and fourth Monarchies, and takes in the beginning of the fifth; ſo that here is very frequently a change of perſons, though the old names are ſtill retained, <hi>King of the North,</hi> and <hi>King of the South.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now the reaſon of the names, in underſtanding which lyes the chief myſtery, and the very Key of the Propheſie, is taken from the <hi>ſituation of parties,</hi> that party in every change, conteſt, skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh here mentioned, whoſe ſituation was more Northerly, goes ever under the title of the <hi>King of the North;</hi> that party whoſe ſituation was more Southerly, under the title of the <hi>King of the South.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>So in the very firſt conteſt, where theſe names are uſed, which was betwixt <hi>Alexanders</hi> two chief Captains after his death, and the diviſion of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchy: the Race of the <hi>Lagidae,</hi> ſo called from <hi>Ptolomeus</hi> the ſon of <hi>Lagus,</hi> the firſt of that Race, is called the <hi>King of the South,</hi> verſ. 5. becauſe their ſituation was in <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> which lay more towards the South. The
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:115824:53"/>Race of the <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> ſo called from <hi>Seleucus Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canor,</hi> the firſt of them, are called the <hi>King of the North,</hi> verſ. 6, 7. becauſe they were ſituated in <hi>Aſſyria, Babylon,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Aſsa,</hi> which did border ſomewhat more upon the North, then the other.</p>
                           <p>So in the next conteſt which begins with the beginning of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, the parts firſt aſſaulted and invaded by the <hi>Romans</hi> when they were reaching after the Monarchy, as <hi>Macedon, Egypt, Judea, &amp;c.</hi> are called the <hi>King of the South,</hi> verſ. 14. becauſe theſe Countries were ſituated Southward from <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> invading are called <hi>King of the North,</hi> verſ. 15. becauſe of their Northern ſituation.</p>
                           <p>And here by the way, give me leave to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what a notable mark the Holy Ghoſt hath left us in this cloſe tranſition from the <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchy to the <hi>Roman,</hi> to give us light where in this Propheſie we are to begin the <hi>Roman</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, which otherwiſe, conſidering how things all along hang as it were in a chain, were a thing moſt difficult to find; verſ. 14. <hi>And in thoſe dayes many ſhall ſtand up againſt the King of the South,</hi> which is a moſt proper deſcription of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy in its firſt riſe, and ſeems to point them out from all the people in the world; for it is obſervable of them that at the time they were growing into a Monarchy, they were governed by a Senate, conſiſting of many perſons, which many alſo, to ſhew us that they are to be underſtood of ſuch a many as do yet make up but one Repreſentative bony, are
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115824:53"/>therefore in the next Verſe called the <hi>King of the North.</hi> The words in the cloſe of the fourteenth Verſe, <hi>They ſhall fall,</hi> which may ſeem to make this Expoſition doubtfull, do not relate to the many ſtanding up againſt the King of the South in the beginning of the Verſe, but to the robbers of thy people in the end, which are not the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> but another people oppoſing the <hi>Romans</hi> in the beginning of their Monarchy, and falling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</p>
                           <p>So likewiſe in the controverſie afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the vile Perſon Antichriſt, and the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracens,</hi> which began about the year one thouſand ninety ſix, the <hi>Turks</hi> upon whom the vile perſon makes War, are called the <hi>King of the South,</hi> verſ. 25. becauſe their ſituation lay Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly from <hi>Rome;</hi> and Antichriſt is <hi>King of the North,</hi> becauſe his Seat was ſituated moſt Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly.</p>
                           <p>This Light gained, ſets open a window to that which follows, from verſe forty to the end of the Chapter. For the better underſtanding whereof let it be noted, <hi>That theſe ſix laſt verſes do ſet forth the very laſt part of that Tragedy that now for a long time together had been acting upon the Stage of the World; and they are not</hi> (as is moſt generally thought) <hi>a repetition of things before delivered, but indeed a continuation of the Prophecy, and that from that very point of time where Antichriſts Tyranny, which is the thing deſcribed in the fore-going verſes, ends.</hi> The deſcription of Antichriſts rage in the fore-going verſes brings us down to the very end of the forty two moneths, the one thouſand two
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115824:54"/>hundred and ſixty days, now with the end of that time begins this Prophecy, which carries things on, but with a ſpecial reſpect to the <hi>Jews</hi> untill Chriſts coming.</p>
                           <p>Hence the time is particularly noted to be the <hi>time of the end,</hi> verſ. 40. <hi>At the time of the end ſhall the King of the South puſh at him;</hi> and in this ſence, viz. for the very concluding time, and ſhutting up of the things here fore-told, is this phraſe uſed throughout this Prophecy, verſ. 27. <hi>The end ſhall be at the time appointed,</hi> verſ. 35. <hi>even to the time of the end, becauſe it is yet for a time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,</hi> ch. 12. v. 4. <hi>Seal the Book even to the time of the end,</hi> verſ. 6. <hi>How long ſhall it be to the end of theſe Wonders?</hi> verſ. 8. <hi>What ſhall be the end of theſe things?</hi> So verſ. 9, 13. <hi>all verifying our ſenſe.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now we are here to remember what I have proved in my Key, That the one thouſand two hundred and ninety days (the time of the <hi>Jews</hi> firſt ſtirring) concur in their end with the forty two months, the one thouſand two hundred and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty days. This noted, things lie thus. The fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going verſes brings us down to the end of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two months, with which time ending, ends likewiſe the one thouſand two hundred and nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty days. Now do the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtir, and get their own Land, which Land of theirs, becauſe it lies Southward from <hi>Rome,</hi> the Seat of the Beaſt, and <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> likewiſe the Seat of the <hi>Turk,</hi> the new-ſtirring <hi>Jews</hi> in oppoſition to theſe take this name, <hi>King of the South.</hi> The <hi>Jews,</hi> this <hi>new King of the South,</hi> being gotten into their Land, puſh at the <hi>Turk</hi> and Pope both; at the one upon
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115824:54"/>a Civil account; at the other upon a Chriſtian, or at leaſtwiſe as favourers of the <hi>Gentile</hi> Saints. This makes Pope and <hi>Turk</hi> (though ſometimes before they had been quarrelling with each other, not herein ſerving any deſign of Chriſt ſo much as their own Luſts; for though they quarrelled, yet it is ſaid of them, verſ. 27. <hi>That both their hearts were ſet to doe miſchief</hi>) now at laſt gaſpe to joyn hands; and as <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> the one a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit <hi>Jew,</hi> the other a profeſſed Heathen, dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enemies to each other before, became friends in oppoſing Chriſt; ſo ſhall Antichriſt and the <hi>Turk,</hi> the one a counterfeit Chriſtian, the other an open Pagan, who till this day lived by one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother as enemies, be now reconciled and made friends, yea become one in oppoſing Chriſts Cauſe, in doing which they ſhall fall together. This combination of theſe two grand Enemies as chief, goes under the name of the <hi>King of the North,</hi> becauſe either of them (as I have ſaid) are Northerly ſituated from <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Theſe combined ſhall come with great fury into the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> and the Countries adjacent, as <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> who ſhall at this day fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the <hi>Jews,</hi> Iſa. 19.23, 24, 25. Here ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the <hi>Jews</hi> black and terrible day of trouble; for this raging <hi>King of the North,</hi> filled with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to ſee a new Enemy riſen up againſt him, and the more becauſe of tidings he hears from the <hi>Eaſt and the North,</hi> verſ. 44. which tidings in likelihood is news brought to him of thoſe <hi>Gentile Saints</hi> (who having been inſtruments of ſetting the <hi>Jews</hi> at firſt in their own Land, and upon
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115824:55"/>that, having done their work, being returned home) now hearing this, march up again from the Northern parts to aſſiſt the <hi>Iews,</hi> and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therewith alſo tidings of other <hi>Iews</hi> coming up to their Land from the Eaſtern Countries. This news ſets him in a great rage, and to the end that he may diſpatch one party firſt, before the other can get up, he marcheth with wonderful fury, reſolving to deſtroy all, into <hi>Iudea,</hi> and up to <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> pitching his Tents in the holy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>i. e.</hi> laying cloſe ſiege to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> as <hi>Ioel</hi> 3.1, 2, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.2, 3. by which the <hi>Iews</hi> ſhall be brought into ſuch ſtraits as never was any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the world. Now in the day of their greateſt ſtraits, when the Enemies rage, and their ſtraits ſhall be at the higheſt, <hi>ſhall</hi> Michael <hi>ſtand up, i. e.</hi> Chriſt appear, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. who inſtantly upon his appearing pours out the ſeventh Vial upon all theſe his enemies, now ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering and gathered together, by which they ſhall come to their end, and none ſhall help them, verſe laſt.</p>
                           <p>Thus this laſt verſe brings us to the point of Chriſts Perſonal appearance, which more fully is opened in the following Chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. all that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows afterwards to the end of the twelfth Chapter, is not of things ſucceeding, but only, firſt a rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall of the ſtate of the <hi>Jews</hi> in the time of their firſt ſtirring, (the handling whereof, that no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption might be cauſed in the Story, is omitted till the diſcourſe was come to an end) which is ſet forth by a reſurrection, <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3. the ſame with <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiels</hi> reſurrection of the dry bones, Chapter 37.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115824:55"/>And afterwards a revealing to <hi>Daniel</hi> the time of theſe things, (viz. their firſt ſtirring, and their compleat deliverance by the appearance of Chriſt;) which is ſet forth by two myſticall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, of which I have diſcourſed at large in <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration work,</hi> Part 3. Chap. 2. Sect. 5. and in my <hi>Key,</hi> Theſ. 17. Theſ. 34.</p>
                           <p>Thus much by way of anſwer to the firſt opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concerning the little Horn, in anſwering which I have been led into ſome things a little out of the way, but not unprofitable.</p>

                           <p>THere is likewiſe another opinion of this little Horn, viz. <hi>That this little Horn ſignifies the late King</hi> Charls, <hi>as ſome; or the whole Norman race, as others;</hi> of theſe two, as touching the firſt, I muſt confeſſe, I have wondered with my ſelf, how any ſhould once imagine that the Holy Ghoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now giving <hi>Daniel</hi> information how things ſhould be agitated in the World from that time untill the time of the end, ſhould at once leap o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the time from the beginning of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, which was long before Chriſt, untill the time of King <hi>Charls,</hi> the whole amounting to well nigh two thouſand years; conſidering too, that the whole Prophecy of the <hi>Revelations</hi> in a manner conſiſts upon things to be fulfilled within this time; and it is wonderfull that throughout this time, a time ſo remarkable for obſervation as never any before it, the Holy Ghoſt, when too (as I ſay) he was in a way of informing <hi>Daniel,</hi>
                              <pb n="78" facs="tcp:115824:56"/>ſhould ſhut up all in ſilence, as if nothing from the time the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy began, were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted or done in the world worthy to bee noted, till King <hi>Charls</hi> aroſe.</p>
                           <p>And as to the ſecond, Though the leap in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of time will be too great to leap from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy untill the time of <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, as if the Holy Ghoſt ſhould in this Prophecy leap over the wonderfull revolutions attending Antichriſts coming into the World, and all his rage when come in (which are things particularly noted in <hi>Daniels</hi> other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies) and obſerve nothing till <hi>William</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror aroſe; yet is the miſtake greater in limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Holy Ghoſt, ſo much as this opinion doth in regard of place; for it tyes up all done within theſe laſt ſix hundred years to <hi>England</hi> only; ſo that although it allow more time then the other, yet is it as ſtrait it in reſpect of place, both confining <hi>Daniels</hi> Prophecy of the little Horn, to things done in <hi>England</hi> only, which no way agrees to the ſcope of the Prophecy, which is to ſet forth the ſtate of the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy. And why we ſhould not as well reſtrain the Apocalypticall Viſions, as the Viſions of <hi>Daniel,</hi> to <hi>England</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I ſee no reaſon to the contrary. This I am ſure, If <hi>Daniels</hi> Prophecies run upon things done only in <hi>England,</hi> in caſe <hi>Johns</hi> doe not ſo too, we cannot make the one Expoſitory of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                           <p>But to paſſe theſe Generals, I ſhall here lay down ſome particular Reaſons to prove that this opinion, take it in either dreſſe, will no way
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:115824:56"/>agree to the minde of the Holy Ghoſt in <hi>Daniel.</hi>

                           <p>Reaſ. 1. <hi>Becauſe this little Horn after his riſe is equivalent to the fourth Beaſt, or Monarchy, ſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame Scepter, having the ſame Seat, or Civil Power;</hi> (which cannot agree to the late King <hi>Charls,</hi> or the <hi>Norman</hi> Race) as is clear.</p>
                           <p n="1">1 <hi>Becauſe</hi> for this Reaſon is the Fourth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy it ſelf, called by the name of the <hi>little Horn,</hi> Dan. 8.9.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 <hi>Becauſe</hi> the fatall deſtruction of the fourth Beaſt, or Monarchy, is for the blaſphemies of the <hi>little Horn,</hi> Dan. 7.11. an Argument the little Horns power did extend it ſelf to the whole Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, having a ſpecial influence upon the whole, both to cauſe it to ſin, and to bring the Wrath of God upon it.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 <hi>Becauſe</hi> the feet and toes of the great Image, chap. 2. (the ſame with the little Horn) are not a particular Nation, but the fourth Kingdome or Monarchy, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. the forty and forty one verſes compared.</p>

                           <p>Reaſ. 3 <hi>Becauſe this opinion doth not agree to the Characters of</hi> Daniels <hi>little Horn, in any of</hi> Daniels <hi>four Prophecies.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="1">1 For the Prophecy of the <hi>Great Image,</hi> the feet
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:115824:57"/>and toes of that Image (the ſame with the little Horn) denote ſuch a power as conſiſts principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ten Parts, ſet forth by the ten toes. This cannot be ſaid of the <hi>Norman</hi> power, take it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as in the laſt King, or any of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 For the Prophecy, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. its ſaid of the Tyrannical King, That his power ſhould <hi>be migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> but this power <hi>none of his own;</hi> that he ſhould <hi>deſtroy wonderfully,</hi> i. e. above all that ever were before him, verſ. 24. That he ſhould <hi>ſtand up alſo againſt the Prince of Princes,</hi> i. e. Chriſt Perſo: nally appearing; That he ſhould <hi>be broken without hand,</hi> verſ. 25.</p>
                           <p>Now apply theſe to King <hi>Charls</hi> that was, or the <hi>Norman</hi> Race in generall, and ſee how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable they are.</p>
                           <p n="1">1 What power did he or they (I mean conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them as they were Kings) exerciſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come mighty thereby, which was none of their own?</p>
                           <p n="2">2 How did he or they, deſtroy wonderfully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all before them? If we take it for a deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Nations, were not others before, as <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar, Cyrus, Alexander</hi> the Great, the <hi>Romans</hi> after them, farre greater deſtroyers of Nations than ever any of the <hi>Norman</hi> Race? but take it for a deſtruction of Saints, becauſe that the following words import, He ſhall deſtroy the mighty and the holy people; and conſider, whether the Pagan Emperours of <hi>Rome</hi> in the firſt three hundred years, and Antichriſt ſince, who each of them have put Millions of Saints to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:115824:57"/>death, were not greater deſtroyers of Saints, then the <hi>Norman</hi> Race.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 Did ever the <hi>Norman</hi> Race oppoſe Chriſt Perſonally appearing? but ſo ſhall this little Horn in the end; for after all his oppoſition to the holy people, he ſtands up with an <hi>alſo</hi> againſt the the Prince of Princes.</p>
                           <p n="4">4 Can it be ſaid of the <hi>Norman</hi> Race their breaking was without hand, who were plucked up by the roots by a Civil power?</p>
                           <p>As for the reſt of the Characters, which alſo belong to this little Horn, verſ. 10.11, 12. Let it be conſidered, whether they do in a more eminent manner (for that muſt be ſaid, or nothing) agree to King <hi>Charles,</hi> or the <hi>Norman</hi> Race in general, then to any other perſon, ſtate, or power that ever was in the world ſince <hi>Daniels</hi> time.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 For the Propheſie Chap. 11. It is ſaid of the <hi>vile perſon,</hi> verſ. 21. <hi>he ſhall come in peaceably,</hi> ſo did not <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror. Obtain the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by flatteries, ſo did not <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> who had it by ſucceſſion.</p>
                           <p>Verſ. 33. <hi>That Saints under him ſhall fall by ſword, by flame, captivity, and ſpoyl many dayes;</hi> but in Scripture-phraſe King <hi>Charles</hi> continuance cannot be called many daies, no nor the continunance of the <hi>Norman</hi> Race; for 600. years is but a ſhort time, and not many dayes, in the account of Scripture.</p>
                           <p>Its ſaid of him, v. 36. <hi>That he ſhall exalt himſelf and magnifie himſelf above every god,</hi> which is the expreſs character of the man of ſin, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Who oppoſeth and exalteth himſelf above all that is called God.</hi> That he ſhall <hi>proſper till the indignation be accompliſhed,</hi>
                              <pb n="82" facs="tcp:115824:58"/>which Chap. 8.19. is called the <hi>laſt end of indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, i.e.</hi> he ſhall perſiſt in his pride and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies till the pouring forth of the laſt Vial, for that is properly the laſt end of indignation, which An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt ſhall do, but the <hi>Norman</hi> Race is plucked up by the roots already.</p>
                           <p>Furthermore its ſaid of the vile perſon, verſ. 37. That he ſhall <hi>not regard the deſire of women,</hi> which agreeth exactly to Antichriſt, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth and voweth chaſtity, forbiddeth and vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth Mariage. But if things recorded be true, and in this we have little cauſe to be ſuſpicious, this Character will agree to few of the <hi>Norman</hi> Race.</p>
                           <p>Again its ſaid of him, that he ſhall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour a God <hi>whom his Fathers knew not,</hi> verſ. 38. called therefore a <hi>ſtrange God,</hi> verſ. 39. which moſt punctually is fulfilled in the Grand Popiſh Idol <hi>the Maſſe,</hi> an Idol never heard of in the world till Antichriſt deviſed it, and ſet it up. But let it be ſhewn what ſtrange God, unknown to his or their Fathers, did King <hi>Charles</hi> or any of his Predeceſſors ſet up, and worſhip?</p>
                           <p n="4">4 For the Propheſie it ſelf, Chap. 7. It is ſaid of this little Horn, verſ. 20. <hi>That his look was more ſtout then his fellows, i.e.</hi> more dreadful, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing to thoſe that beheld him, then the look of any of the other Horns. But now let it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially conſidered, whether the look of King <hi>Charles</hi> that was, or his Predeceſſors in the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Race, were ever more dreadful and terrible to the Saints, or in particular to the Saints under their power, then the look of any of the other
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:115824:58"/>Horns! I do beleeve, yea know Hiſtories will make the contrary appear.</p>
                           <p>To all the reſt I may adde, as none of the leaſt, the Argument urged in my <hi>Key, Theſi</hi> 39.</p>
                           <p>The head of all the Arguments brought for this opinion, take it in its firſt or ſecond dreſs, are cut off at one blow, or with ſaying one word, <hi>viz.</hi> That as what is ſpoken of Tyrants in general, may in moſt things agree to every particular Tyrant; what is ſpoken of the whole body, in many things to every part; ſo what is here by <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpoken of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, the Grand Tyrant, and the whole body, may in many things very fitly agree to the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Race in general, or King <hi>Charles</hi> that was in particular, they being Tyrants, and alſo a part of this body; yet doth it not therefore follow that the one or the other are here ſolely intended.</p>
                           <p>The Concluſion is, <hi>That</hi> Daniels <hi>little Horn is neither the</hi> Norman <hi>Race in general, nor King</hi> Charles <hi>in particular; But is indeed the Romiſh An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, to whom</hi> (had I leaſure, or opportunity here to undertake the work) <hi>I doubt not through the Lords aſſiſtance, but to make it appear, that there is not a title in any of the Propheſies of</hi> Daniel, <hi>but will naturally, without forcing the Text agree, which wil not to any other opinion what ſoever.</hi>

                           <p>But it will be ſaid, how will we ſolve the Grand Objection we ſtarted at firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaw the riſe of this little Horn, after the riſe of the other Horns?</p>

                              <hi>Anſ.</hi> My anſwer is this, <hi>viz. That the ten Horns</hi> Daniel <hi>ſpeaks of, among which, or after which came up the little Horn, are not the ten Horns of the Beaſt Antichriſt, but of the Beaſt the fourth Monarchy.</hi> Now Antichriſts Kingdome, and the fourth Monarchy differ as the part, and the whole; Antichriſts Kingdome being not the fourth Monarchy, but a part or limb thereof only.</p>
                           <p>That the fourth Beaſt in <hi>Daniel,</hi> is not Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts Kingdome, but the fourth Monarchy in general, is clear;</p>
                           <p n="1">1 Becauſe the fourth Beaſt ſucceeds ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in the room of the other three Beaſts, <hi>i.e.</hi> takes the place of the three former Monarchies, ſo ſoon as the third Monarchy was diſſolved. But this did not Antichriſts Kingdome, whoſe riſe was not till ſome hundreds of years after the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the third Monarchy; yet it excellently agrees to the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy in general.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 Becauſe <hi>Daniels</hi> fourth Beaſt is exceeding terrible, breaks in peeces, and ſtamps all the other Beaſts, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.7. which thing will not agree to Antichriſts Kingdome, but to the Roman Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy in general.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 Becauſe the fourth Beaſt in <hi>Daniel</hi> is diverſe from all the Beaſts before it, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.3, 7. but now the deſcription of the Beaſt Antichriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.2. argues him to be in ſome things like them all; For firſt he is like a Leopard; <hi>And the Beaſt which I ſaw was like unto a Leopard,</hi> which is the ſimilitude of <hi>Daniels</hi> third Beaſt, or the <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchy, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.6. Secondly, He hath feet as the feet of a Bear, <hi>And his feet were as the feet of a Bear,</hi> which is the ſimilitude of <hi>Daniels</hi> ſecond
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:115824:59"/>Beaſt, or the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy, verſ. 5. Thirdly, His mouth is as the mouth of a Lyon, which reſembles <hi>Daniels</hi> firſt Beaſt, or the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy; ſo that Antichriſt hath the ſimilitude of all the former Beaſts; but <hi>Daniels</hi> fourth Beaſt is diverſe from them all.</p>
                           <p n="4">4 Becauſe there ſhould be no diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the fourth Beaſt, and the little Horn, in caſe the fourth Beaſt be to be underſtood of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts Kingdome; for that is the thing ſet forth by the little Horn.</p>
                           <p n="5">5 Becauſe the riſe of <hi>Daniels</hi> fourth Beaſt is clearly and plainly noted to be before the riſe of Antichriſts Kingdome; for the riſe of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts Kingdome begun in the riſe of the little Horn; but the fourth Beaſt with all his Horns, was riſen before that; how elſe is the little Horn ſaid to riſe among, and after the other Horns? I conclude therefore that <hi>Daniels</hi> fourth Beaſt is the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy in general, as <hi>Johns</hi> Beaſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.1, 2. is the ſame only as under Antichriſt.</p>
                           <p>Now this being ſo, it is to be noted, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy from its beginning, take it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as it was in its pure Civil ſtate, or as it now is in its mixt Antichriſtian ſtate, had ever ten Horns. As it was a pure Civil ſtate, ſo was it exactly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into ten parts in the dayes of <hi>Auguſtus Ceſar,</hi> as <hi>Strabo</hi> witneſſeth. And for this reaſon, the Dragon, which repreſents the old Empire, hath as well ten Horns, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.3. as the Beaſt, Chap. 13.1. yet with this difference, the ten Horns of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy in its firſt ſtate had no Crown <hi>i.e.</hi> the Kingdomes ſubjected to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115824:60"/>the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, whilſt it remained a pure Civil ſtate, had not Legiſlative power within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but rather were kept in the nature of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, over whom the <hi>Roman</hi> ſtate did ſet titular Kings (as <hi>Herod</hi> in Chriſts time was the titular King of <hi>Judea,</hi> and for this reaſon, becauſe ſo in title, they are called Kings, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.24.) but yet did ſtill reſerve to it ſelf the power of making and giving laws; as in Chriſts time, beſides <hi>Herod</hi> the titular King, there was <hi>Pilate</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſet over the Land to execute Laws, which Laws executed were only the Laws of <hi>Rome;</hi> and hence Chriſt is ſaid to be crucified in <hi>Rome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſuffered by the Law and Power of <hi>Rome, Rev.</hi> 11.8.</p>
                           <p>And alſo it is for this reaſon, that the Dragon repreſenting the old Empire is ſaid to have his Crowns, not upon his Horns as the Beaſt, Chap. 13.1. but upon his ſeven Heads; that is, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative power all the time of the old Empire is continued at <hi>Rome,</hi> built upon ſeven Mountains, which are theſe ſeven Heads, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.9. Yea far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is for this reaſon, that <hi>John</hi> ſpeaking of the ten Kings, as having a being even then when he wrote, ſaith, Chap. 17.12. that as yet they had received no Kingdome, but were afterwards to receive power as Kings, namely with the Beaſt, <hi>i.e.</hi> though all the ten Horns were then in being, yet were they then onely titular Kings, who had no power of making or giving Laws, this power as yet abiding upon the Heads, <hi>i.e.</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf. But now the Horns of the Beaſt Antichriſt, <hi>i.e.</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy as under Antichriſt, have
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:115824:60"/>Crowns upon them, <hi>i.e.</hi> that Legiſlative power which was before upon the Heads, is now tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Horns; every particular Kingdome, which before were but as Provinces, governed by no other Laws but ſuch as came from <hi>Rome,</hi> hath now a power within it ſelf to rule, and to make Laws; therefore ſaith <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 17.12. the ten Horns receive power as Kings with the Beaſt, that is, when the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy which then was in the hands of Emperors, and the whole governed by the Laws of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhall fall in the hands of the Beaſt, then ſhall thoſe ſeveral Kings which before were titular, only receive Kingly power, or power as Kings to make and give Laws within their own Dominions, without receiving their Laws from any foreign place or power.</p>
                           <p>Now conſider the ten Horns in the firſt reſpect as they are the Horns of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral (which is clearly <hi>Daniels</hi> ſenſe, the ten Horns he ſpeaks of being the Horns of the fourth Beaſt, <hi>i.e.</hi> the Empire in general; for ſaith he, verſ. 7. <hi>It</hi> (that is the fourth Beaſt) <hi>had ten Horns</hi>) and it is moſt clear the riſe of Antichriſt, <hi>the little Horn,</hi> was among and after theſe Horns. And therefore obſerve the words narrowly, it is ſaid, that <hi>at the time of the little Horns riſe, three of the firſt are plucked up by the roots,</hi> verſ. 8. what is the meaning? why this; the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy in either ſtate (as I have ſaid) had ten Horns; now upon the <hi>little Horns</hi> riſe, three of the firſt, <hi>i.e. three of the Horns of the Roman Monarchy as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in its firſt ſtate were plucked up.</hi> And hence verſ. 24. <hi>The little Horn is ſaid to be diverſe from
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:115824:61"/>the firſt,</hi> that is, <hi>from all the Horns of this Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy in its firſt ſtate;</hi> For of the Horns of the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy in its ſecond ſtate, how is the <hi>little Horn</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, when as the ten Horns in this ſtate are but a part of this little Horn, <hi>i.e.</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy as governed by Antichriſt?</p>
                           <p>And thus to underſtand it, unties that great knot, verſ. 8. <hi>of three Horns being plucked up by the roots before the little Horn at the time of this riſe:</hi> for taking <hi>three</hi> to ſignifie not ſtrictly three, but divers or many (three being uſed becauſe a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of perfection) and how clear is it from all Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories that upon the invaſion made by the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> with which the Beaſt roſe, as before a conſiderable part of thoſe Provinces, which were before ſubjected to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and ruled by its Laws, were now broken off, and grew up into particular Kingdomes ruled by Laws of their own, and ſo by degrees the whole Legiſlative power crept off from the ſeventh and laſt Head to the Horns?</p>
                           <p>And thus interpreted, this place in <hi>Daniel</hi> doth excellently point out the time of the Beaſts riſe; and I take it, that it is left us by the holy Ghoſt as a divine Character to guide us where we ſhould end the firſt ſtate of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin its ſecond; where we ſhould put a period to the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, as a pure Civil ſtate, and begin it as an Antichriſtian; namely with the time when a remarkable breach or rupture ſhould be made among the firſt ten horns, or the ten horns of the Monarchy, as in its firſt ſtate; with this time, and among the horns thus broken ſhould the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:115824:61"/>little Horn creep up, i.e. from thence ſhould the tranſlation of the Monarchy be, or from thence ſhould Antichriſts Kingdom begin; ſo that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed theſe words are ſo farre from weakning what we have aſſerted, that they are a ſtrong confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our beginning, that wee have ſtated it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, in ſtating the riſe of the Beaſt, Antichriſt, to be with the time of the invaſion of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thus notwithſtanding the Objection, our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument ſtands firm, viz. <hi>That the riſe of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Beaſt is a little before the riſe of his Horns; and therefore his Horns riſing ſuddenly after the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty days, the forty two months, the riſe of the Beaſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is ſtated rightly with the year three hundred ninety ſix.</hi>

                           <p>To the Arguments already laid down, I ſhall adde an Argument or two more.</p>
                           <p>Arg. 1. <hi>The aforeſaid ending of the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty days agrees moſt fitly to the time of killing the Witneſſes;</hi> The time of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes killing (which is to be reckoned the laſt three days &amp; a half of the one thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty, as ſee <hi>Generation Work,</hi> Part 3. Chap. 1. Sect. 4.) falls under the third Vial, and a little before the firſt ſtirring of the <hi>Jews</hi> (as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo there proved, Sect. 5. in the firſt and third con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions) now as the third Vial is the Vial wee at preſent ſtand under, as my diſcourſe upon that
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:115824:62"/>Vial manifeſts; ſo the firſt ſtirring of the <hi>Iews</hi> fals to be in the year one thouſand ſix hundred fifty ſix, as is proved, <hi>Key, Theſi.</hi> 20, therefore it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees well to the one and the other, to end the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty days with the year one thouſand ſix hundred fifty ſix.</p>
                           <p>Arg. 2. <hi>Taken from the viſibility of thoſe very things at this day, which the Scripture hath fore-told us ſhall occur within the laſt three days and a half of the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>To give ſome inſtances.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, The Scripture fore-tels, that within this time the Witneſſes ſhall lie dead; <hi>Their death ſhall be civil, and Spiritual;</hi> Civil in being ſtripped of Religion, and Liberty; Spiritual, in ſubjecting themſelves (through a ſpirit of cowardize upon them) to this Tyranny of the Beaſt, rather then to run the hazard of life in oppoſing him. <hi>The place of their lying dead ſhall be Germany;</hi> the one to be their death, the other the place, I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>Generation Work,</hi> Part 3. Chap. 1. Sect. 7, 8. whether (conſidering the thing, time, and place) have we not more then a little ground to conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, that the preſent day is the day of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes killing? and if ſo, then conſidering that this time is the laſt three days and a half of the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty, doth it not ſpeak that the year we have ſtated as the end of the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty is the right, viz. <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> one thouſand ſix hundred fifty ſix.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, The Scripture fore-tels, <hi>That with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the laſt three days and a half of the one thouſand
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:115824:62"/>two hundred and ſixty, A war ſhall bee attempted;</hi> Firſt, by the inviſible Dragon, then by the viſible, (of which read <hi>Generation Work,</hi> Part 3. Chap. 2. Sect. laſt) againſt a remnant of the Womans Seed, that ſhall ſtand up for Chriſt in the World, within the day that their Brethren the Witneſſes lie dead, which ſhal be known by theſe two Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters; 1. <hi>They ſhall walk in Goſpel inſtitutions.</hi> 2. <hi>Have amongſt them a Spirit of Prophecy.</hi> Now whether the beginnings of the firſt War, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities of the ſecond, be not at this day more viſible upon a people, having the aforeſaid Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters then ever heretofore, I propound as a Quaere?</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, The Scripture fore-tels that there ſhall be within this time <hi>a people in the World that ſhall favour the Witneſſes, and withall be ſo potent as to awe the Beaſt</hi> (of whom mention is made, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat. Work, Part 3. Chap. 1. Sect. 9.) <hi>Who yet ſetling themſelves upon a worldly intereſt as their higheſt ayme, ſhall neither openly declare for the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes Cauſe, nor againſt the Beaſt;</hi> Theſe are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>They of the People, and Nations, and Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, and Tongues,</hi> Revel. 11.9. which cannot be interpreted the Popiſh party, though <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.15. they are ſo deſcribed, becauſe in this place they are diſtinguiſhed from the Popiſh party, which in the following verſe are ſet forth by another name, viz. <hi>The dwellers on the earth.</hi> Whether or no ſuch a people be not now to be found, I alſo put the queſtion?</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, The Scripture fore-tels, That with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this time <hi>there ſhall be a great League and combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:115824:63"/>of Nations</hi> (the Beaſt now gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Powers to defend himſelf, the time being come that his Dominion is to be taken away; as the Fourth Monarchy afterwards, at the end of the one thouſand three hundred thirty five dayes, (when it is to go to ruine) gathers together all its power to that dreadful Battle of <hi>Armageddon</hi> to uphold it ſelf.) Whether a Work like this be not now on foot likewiſe, I propound as another Quaere?</p>
                           <p>Fifthly, The Scripture fore-tels, That within this time there ſhall be in the World <hi>a wonderfull triumph over the dead and ſuppreſſed Witneſſes, as ſuppoſing they and their Cauſe likewiſe to be now dead and ſunk for ever,</hi> Revel. 11.10. Chap. 18.7. Whether doth the preſent time afford nothing that hath a look like this? If all theſe things bee found true at this day, have they not in them the weight of an Argument to prove, That wee are upon the very ending time of the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty days?</p>
                           <p>Arg. 3. <hi>The forty two months, the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty days may not be begun either higher of lower; therefore they muſt bee begun with the aforeſaid year.</hi> That they may not bee begun any time higher, is clear, becauſe from ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings the time is expired; but this cannot be, becauſe the Witneſſes to this very day (my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is throughout all Europe, but all muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe in moſt places, as <hi>Germany, France, &amp;c.</hi>) do yet wear their Sackcloth; the Woman as to this day abides in the Wilderneſs, the Beaſt as to this day, (I really think in all the ten Horns, but as to the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:115824:63"/>greater part of them it is undeniable) doth yet continue to <hi>rage againſt the Saints,</hi> by perſecuting them under the Notion <hi>of Hereticks, or Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> or <hi>Enemies to Civil Government</hi> (becauſe they cannot but declare, That the day is come, in which God will deſtroy, as well his Monarchical Power, as his Spiritual, and Eccleſiaſtical) <hi>to tread under foot the holy City,</hi> by eſtabliſhing Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers not of Chriſt, but his own creating, to bee Lords over Gods heritage; <hi>to blaſpheme God,</hi> by blaſpheming (as did the wicked <hi>Phariſees</hi>) thoſe very Works and Truths of God, counting them Erroneous, Diabolical, which yet take him at ſome times, when he is in his beſt mood, hee is convinced in his Conſcience are of God; yea and fears (maugre all his oppoſition) that theſe things will prove his undoing, <hi>to tyrannize over the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> by continuing thoſe unrighteous Laws, Cuſtoms, &amp;c. which were at firſt impoſed by the Beaſt, that by theſe he might like an imperious Whore ſit domineering upon the waters, <hi>Revel.</hi> 17.1.15. that is, bee a Tyrant over the People. Now I ſay, conſidering that all theſe things are in being unto this very day (yea and that in all the ten Horns, to him that hath but half an eye to ſee) it cannot be that the forty two months, the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty days, (which are the limited time of the Witneſſes wearing Sackcloth, the Womans being in the Wilderneſs, the Beaſts rage againſt the Saints, treading under foot the Holy City, his blaſpheming God, and his Truth, his Tyranny over the Nations) ſhould be begun higher, then our aforeſaid beginning,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:115824:64"/>for then ſhould we ſee a perfect end of thoſe things (in part, <hi>i.e.</hi>) in ſome of the ten Horns at leaſt, which yet wee ſee to have being and exiſt, yea to be maintained in every one of them; I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conclude, That the forty two months, the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty days, cannot be begun higher then the year I have ſtated.</p>
                           <p>That they cannot be begun lower, is clear and manifeſt, becauſe it is a monſtrous abſurdity to ſay, That all the Beaſts Horns ſhould ſpring up, before yet the Beaſt was brought forth; but (as I have proved at large in the fore-going diſcourſe) all the Horns were come forth, but a few years lower then the ſtated year; therefore muſt the time of the Beaſts riſe (who naturally hath being before his Horns) be, as I have ſtated it, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without that groſſe abſurdity of placing the Beaſt after his Horns, bee placed lower. Again, All that begin lower, do not begin from the time of Antichriſts Infancy, or from the time of his firſt riſe; (which none can or do deny, but it was as early as we have ſtated it; the teſtimonies of all the Ancients being ſo full, as touching the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful defection that was in the Church about that time;) but rather they begin from the time of his growth, either his full growth, his perfect matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or his growth in part only; but now this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning is expreſly againſt the Prophecy of the Beaſt, which points us to the time of the Beaſts firſt riſe, as the time whence we are to reckon his forty two months.</p>
                           <p>This we may ſee, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. in verſ. 5. It is ſaid, <hi>Power was given to him to continue forty two months.</hi>
                              <pb n="95" facs="tcp:115824:64"/>Whence are we to reckon theſe forty two months? <hi>Anſ.</hi> From the day he firſt received his power and authority from the Dragon, verſ. 2. <hi>The Dragon gave him his Power, and his Seat, and great An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi> And when was that? <hi>Anſ.</hi> At the time of his firſt riſe, verſ. 1. <hi>I ſaw a Beaſt riſe up out of the Sea, having ſeven Heads, and ten Horns, and the Dragon gave him his power, &amp;c.</hi> Farther, Let it be conſidered, that the ſecond Beaſt, or the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical ſtate of Antichriſt is ſet forth under a three-fold repreſentation in the Book of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> ſuitable to his three-fold State, viz. of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, Maturity, Old Age.</p>
                           <p n="1">1 In his Infant ſtate, He is <hi>a poor deſpicable Beaſt,</hi> creeping out of the earth, but not able as yet to make the Nations crouch to him, and therefore he borrows the power of the firſt Beaſt, <hi>i.e.</hi> of the Civil Magiſtrate, thereby to carry on his own deſigns, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.11, 12.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 In his Mature ſtate the Beaſt ſits as <hi>a rich proud imperious Whore</hi> upon the Nations, <hi>Revel.</hi> 17.1. compared with 15. and rides upon the back of the firſt Beaſt, or the Magiſtraticall power of Nations, ver. 3. ruling them, and the Nations under them, making them do even what this Beaſt liſts.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 In his declining ſtate, or Old Age, hee is <hi>a falſe Prophet,</hi> i.e. hee counterfeits abundance of Holineſs, more then indeed he hath, or ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore profeſſed; the reaſon where of I take to be; the firſt Beaſt through his long riding and galling of him, now begins to kick, and will by no means endure his Rider any longer; the Nations begin
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:115824:65"/>to ſee, that this Beaſt is not indeed (as they have been all along held in hand, and made beleeve) the Woman, the true Church, but a very Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, that by Whoring and Juggling hath in all Ages made her ſelf rich, perſecuted the Saints, enſlaved them; this makes the Nations begin to ſpurn likewiſe at this Beaſt. This Beaſt now fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a downfall, and knowing full well that if there be not ſome way found out to keep up his eſteem with the firſt Beaſt, and the Nations, he is undone; he <hi>Proteus</hi>-like (for indeed he is a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, never heard of in the world till Antichriſts Kingdom began) changeth ſhapes, and as at firſt of a poor ragged Beaſt became (opportunity ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him) a proud Whore; ſo now the Beaſt when he can be a ruling, commanding Whore no longer, transforms himſelf into a falſe Prophet, pretending abundance of Holineſſe, that hereby he may keep up that eſteem ſtill with the firſt Beaſt, and the Nations, which once he had, but hath wel-nigh loſt, through his domineering pride and imperiouſneſs. This is the true ſtate of the ſecond Beaſt (or of Antichriſt, as conſidered in his Eccleſiaſtical ſtate) throughout the Book of the <hi>Revelations.</hi> And of this I have more fully treated, in my diſcourſe upon the Vials, <hi>p.</hi> 101. to the 112. Now obſerve thoſe who begin the Kingdom of Antichriſt from the time of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts growth, or maturity, leave out the firſt ſtate of the ſecond Beaſt, and begin their account with his ſecond; which certainly we muſt not do, but muſt carry our beginning ſo high, as to take in all the three, as the Holy Ghoſt hath laid them
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:115824:65"/>down; I therefore conclude, that wee may not begin lower then the aforeſaid year, three hundred ninety ſix.</p>
                           <p>Seeing therefore that we may not begin either higher or lower, it neceſſarily follows that wee muſt begin with the year we have fixed upon, viz. three hundred ninety ſix; to which number ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one thouſand two hundred and ſixty, the whole makes up one thouſand ſix hundred fifty ſix.</p>
                           <p>The reſult of my whole diſcourſe in this Second Part is, <hi>That the utmost period of the Beaſts conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, the treading under foot the Holy City, the Womans being in the Wilderneſs, the Witneſſes Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying in Sackcloth, all which things are concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, will in greateſt probability be,</hi> Anno Dom. <hi>one thouſand ſix hundred fifty ſix.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thus <hi>Iohns</hi> one thouſand two hundred and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty days expire in the ſame year with <hi>Daniels</hi> one thouſand two hundred and ninety. Thus likewiſe in that very year in which from the Creation the Flood came upon the corrupted old World, in that very year from our Redemption, cometh the flood of Gods wrath upon the Idolatrous An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian world.</p>

                           <p>The common-road opinion, is, that the <hi>little Horn</hi> mentioned in this eight of <hi>Daniel</hi> is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes;</hi> the two thouſand and three hundred days to be natural dayes, a day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of four and twenty hours: ſo the whole ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up ſix years, three months, and twenty dayes, which the Authors &amp; Favourers of this opinion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the time of <hi>Antiochus rage</hi> againſt the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now in order to our anſwer hereunto, let us premiſe, That the <hi>Feet and Toes</hi> of the Great Image, Chap. 2. The <hi>little Horn,</hi> Chap. 7. The <hi>vile perſon,</hi> Chap. 11. who is deſcribed from verſ. 21. to verſ. 40. and the <hi>little Horn</hi> in his <hi>ſecond ſtate,</hi> or ſecond waxing great, in this eighth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>are one and the ſame,</hi> the very ſame ſtate or perſon (if a particular perſon be here meant) is ſignified by all theſe.</p>
                           <p>And this needs no proof, becauſe the common opinion hath granted it, by making application
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:115824:67"/>of all that the Holy Ghoſt hath ſpoken, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either of theſe, to that horrible Monſter <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus Epiphanes;</hi> thereby plainly confeſſing that <hi>one and the ſame thing</hi> is ſignified in the aforeſaid parts of each Propheſie.</p>
                           <p>This premiſed, let us examine what truth there is in this principle ſo much hugged and contended for by many, as the onely door of light into <hi>Daniel.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And although more can hardly be ſaid in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer hereunto then what hath been already by ſome worthy men of later times, who have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed themſelves to this opinion, as Mr. <hi>Archer</hi> in his Perſonal Reign, The Author of <hi>Clavis Apocalyptica ad incudem revocata,</hi> but above all, the learned <hi>Parker</hi> in his <hi>Daniels</hi> Viſions and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies expounded; yet becauſe in principles that men are wedded too (as ordinarily they are to all, be they right or wrong, that have but a crowd of learned men to Patronize them) they had rather (to uſe the Popiſh Proverb) <hi>beleeve as the Church beleeves,</hi> then look out for an Author that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their mind. I think it worth my pains in oppoſition to this opinion, to preſent here (though I ſhall but multiply whilſt I ſo do things already publiſhed) ſome of thoſe Arguments that are and may be brought againſt it; not doubting but that thoſe who ſincerely love truth, will ſee reaſon enough to be of my mind; as for others, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the genius of this age, which is to be ſick, ſullen, and humorſome, when any truth croſſeth thoſe principles they have received by tradition from their Fore-fathers, have a principle or a
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:115824:67"/>will (I know not which I may call it) that they will not ſee any thing but with the eyes of their Fore-fathers, or the multitude of the learned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the time, let Scripture or right reaſon ſpeak ever ſo clear or punctual; I leave ſuch to the judgement of being yet farther blinded.</p>
                           <p>But to come to the opinion it ſelf, the Queſtion is, <hi>Whether doth this Propheſie,</hi> Chap. 8. <hi>run upon</hi> Antiochus Epiphanes <hi>or no?</hi> This reſolved, it will be eaſily determined whether the dayes are Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or Prophetical.</p>
                           <p>To this I anſwer, That <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> notwithſtanding Commentators have fearfully and ſhamefully ſtretched the Text, Reaſon, and the very ſinews of the ancient Hiſtories to gather up ſomething that might colourably make the whole to agree to him, cannot be the perſon here meant, unleſſe we look upon him as a common Tyrant and Perſecutor, and ſo I deny not but that many things ſpoken of Antichriſt that Grand Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and Perſecutor of the Saints, may very fitly be applied to him. Yea I think withall that there might be a ſpecial deſign of God in it, that many of the things here mentioned ſhould be fairly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable to him and others, that ſo thereby doors of miſtake might be left open, and by it the Propheſie kept ſealed (which otherwiſe in an ordinary way could not have been) untill the appointed time. And the ſame deſign ſeems to me to run alſo through the Book of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> in opening which it is very eaſie to miſtake, if every thing which hath a plauſible look, and fair colour out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, may preſently be taken up as an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation.</p>
                           <pb n="102" facs="tcp:115824:68"/>
                           <p>But to paſſe this, and come to the thing, That this Propheſie (as holds the common opinion) ſhould terminate in <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> and ſo have its fulfilling before the firſt coming of Chriſt, cannot be.</p>
                           <p>My Reaſon is, <hi>Becauſe it will not agree to the mind of the Holy Ghoſt in any one of</hi> Daniels <hi>four Propheſier before mentioned.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Firſt, To begin with that of the <hi>Great Image.</hi> Chap. 2. This opinion doth no way correſpond with the truth of that Propheſie.</p>
                           <p n="1">1 Becauſe <hi>that Propheſie runs down into the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dayes</hi> (or the end of dayes, as our new Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationiſts upon the Bible render it) verſ. 28. <hi>But there is a God in Heaven that revealeth ſecrets, and maketh known to the King</hi> Nebuchadnezzar <hi>what ſhall be in the latter dayes.</hi> But this cannot be, ſhould the whole have its accompliſhment two hundred years before Chriſts birth, as this opinion doth, and muſt neceſſarily maintain; for <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus Epiphanes</hi> whoſe Kingdome they will have to belong to the Feet and Toes (which are the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme and utmoſt parts of the Image, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the cloſe of the Propheſie) reigned two hundred years before the birth of Chriſt.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 Becauſe <hi>the Iron legs are called the fourth Kingdome or Monarchy,</hi> verſ. 40. <hi>And the fourth Kingdome ſhall be ſtrong as Iron;</hi> but this opinion which applies the legs and feet to the Race of the <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> and <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> one of that Race, makes the Iron legs and feet a part of the third Kingdome or Monarchy; for the houſe of the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> and <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> are
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:115824:68"/>by Chronologers generally reckoned as a part of the third or <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchy.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 Becauſe <hi>the fourth Kingdome is that which breaks in peeces all the foregoing Kingdomes and Monarchies, i.e.</hi> it ſubdues to it ſelf whatſoever was before ſubject to any of the other Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, verſ. 40. for as much as Iron breaketh in peeces and ſubdueth all things, and as Iron that breaketh all theſe, ſhall it break in peeces and bruiſe.</p>
                           <p>This alſo appears from verſ. 35. becauſe the ſtone that ſmites, upon its ſmiting, breaks the Braſſe, the Silver, the Gold, as well as the Iron and Clay, though yet it ſmites no other but the feet of Iron and Clay, which ſhews that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was in the three firſt parts of Gold, Silver, Braſſe, was now by ſucceſſion come to the Iron and Clay, which ſmitten, the whole is broken. But this was never done by the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, nor <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> in ſpecial, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot relate to him or them, but had a punctual fulfilling in the Roman Monarchy, which ſucceeded the Grecian, and ſwallowed up whatſoever the foregoing Monarchies poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed.</p>
                           <p n="4">4 Becauſe <hi>in the dayes of theſe Kings the God of Heaven ſets up his own Kingdome,</hi> verſ. 44. But this Kingdome (according to the principle of thoſe who are our Opponents, who begin it not till Chriſts Birth) was not ſet up in the dayes of the <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> nor of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes;</hi> for the whole Kingdome of the <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> yea the whole Greek Empire (lower then which this
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:115824:69"/>opinion looks not) was utterly diſſolved many years before Chriſts Birth.</p>
                           <p n="5">5 Becauſe <hi>it is Chriſts Kingdome, repreſented by the Stone, which by ſmiting breaks in peeces that Kingdome, which by the Feet and Toes of the Great Image is ſet forth,</hi> verſ. 34. <hi>Thou ſawest till that a Stone was cut out without hands, which ſmote the Image upon his feet that were of Iron and Clay, and brake them to peeces;</hi> But it was not Chriſts Kingdome, but the Pagan power of the Roman Empire that deſtroyed and brake in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Kingdome of the <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> of which <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus Epiphanes</hi> was a limb; therefore cannot the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> or <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> be underſtood by the Feet and Toes of the Great Image.</p>
                           <p n="6">6 Becauſe <hi>the ſtone that ſmiting the Great Image breaks it to peeces, cannot be Chriſts ſpiritual Kingdome, ſet up upon his firſt coming,</hi> which this opinion as it doth ſay, ſo muſt it, or ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                           <p n="1">1 Becauſe this Kingdome take its riſe where the Feet and Toes are ſmitten; but Chriſts ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Kingdome did not riſe till many years after the Feet and Toes, in the ſenſe of the Patrons of this opinion, were wholly diſſolved, and in being no longer.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 Becauſe this Kingdome cannot become a mountain filling the whole earth ſo long as the Great Image, <hi>i.e. Worldly powers</hi> ſtand, which is clear, becauſe upon the totall diſſolution of the Great Image, it becomes a Mountain, and not before, verſ. 34, 35. But now Chriſts ſpiritual Kingdome may be a Mountain filling the earth
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:115824:69"/>in a ſpiritual ſenſe, though the Great Image be not broken in peeces, <hi>i.e.</hi> though <hi>worldly powers</hi> are ſtanding.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 Becauſe ſuch a Kingdome is ſignified by the Stone as was repreſented by the Great Image; for the Kingdome of the Stone takes the place of the Great Image upon its diſſolution. But the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or Kingdomes ſignified by the Great Image were not ſpiritual, but outward; therefore ſuch muſt be the Kingdome of the Stone.</p>
                           <p n="4">4 Becauſe ſuch a Kingdome is here meant as muſt anſwer to <hi>Daniels</hi> ſcope in his anſwer to the Kings Dream. But if this Kingdome were ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual only, then <hi>Daniel</hi> had miſſed the ſoope much; for <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> thoughts run of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, according to which thoughts the Dream was directed, and <hi>Daniel</hi> interpreting it, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to reſolve him fully: For in a word (as ſaith Mr. <hi>Huet</hi> whoſe Argument this is) <hi>Daniel</hi> intends two main points:</p>
                           <p n="1">1 To comfort the <hi>Jews</hi> in the loſſe of their Kingdome and Liberty, ſhewing that after many changes it ſhould be reſtored to them again.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 To convince the King of his Tyranny over them, by which his third Heir ſhould be nothing the warmer; another ſhould take it from him, a third from him, and a fourth from him, which at length (maugre all their deſpight) ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the <hi>Jews</hi> in greater glory then ever they loſt it. Now whether the Spiritual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt doth anſwer this ſcope or no, I leave (ſaith he) to the judgement of the godly wiſe.</p>
                           <pb n="106" facs="tcp:115824:70"/>
                           <p n="5">5 Becauſe ſuch a Kingdom is here intended as was to be continued to the <hi>Jews</hi> (after once they ſhould be poſſeſſed thereof) without alteration. So the Text, <hi>It ſhall not be given to another people,</hi> i.e. from <hi>Daniels</hi> people; but when Chriſt came, and brought his Spiritual Kingdom (whiles to be meerly Spiritual) he firſt preached the Goſpel to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from whom notwithſtanding the Goſpel was taken away and given to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="6">6 Becauſe the proper work of the Stone, to which it is appointed, is to break in peeces earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Kingdoms, verſ. 44 but Chriſts Spiritual Kingdom ſet up upon his firſt coming was not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to any ſuch end; for then would not Chriſt have commanded a ſubjection of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects thereof to worldly powers.</p>
                           <p n="7">7 And laſtly, <hi>What</hi> prerogative and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had it been for the Kingdom of Chriſt Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, to have broken down the <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> and other Horns of the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire, ſo long as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Kingdom, the Kingdom of the <hi>Romans</hi> ſucceeded in their place to beat down the Church by the Heathen Emperours, and Antichriſt, for longer ſpace of time, and with greater and more terrible perſecution then ever was before?</p>
                           <p>This opinion therefore cannot agree to <hi>Daniels</hi> firſt Viſion, of the Great Image.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, for <hi>Daniels</hi> ſecond Viſion of <hi>the four Beaſts,</hi> Chap. 7. it no way agrees to it; for it cannot be that the <hi>fourth Beaſt,</hi> having <hi>ten Horns,</hi> verſ. 7. ſhould be the Houſe of the <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> or that the <hi>little Horn,</hi> verſ. 8. ſhould be <hi>Antiochus,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:115824:70"/>Epiphanes,</hi> as this opinion holds.</p>
                           <p>I ſhall here oppoſe only the Arguments al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> from the learned <hi>Graſerus</hi> in anſwer to it, as judging them ſufficient, though yet if need be, there is more to be ſpoken.</p>
                           <p>Arg. 1 <hi>The Kingdom of the</hi> Seleucidae <hi>belongeth to the Third Beaſt, and is one of the four Parts into which the</hi> Grecian <hi>Kingdom was divided after</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexanders <hi>death, expreſly repreſented in his four wings, and four Heads,</hi> verſ. 6. the truth of which interpretation will clearly appear by comparing with chap. 8.8.22. chap. 11.4. for the King of <hi>Grecia</hi> is expreſly diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Alexander,</hi> as the whole from the part, comprehending both him, and the <hi>quadrupartite</hi> diviſion among his Succeſſors, chap. 8.21, 22. therefore both he and the <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> with other his Succeſſors, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the third Beaſt, and cannot be extended to the fourth.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 <hi>Becauſe theſe four Beaſts aroſe ſucceſsively to ſubdue the world, verſ.</hi> 2, 3. <hi>but the</hi> Seleucidae, <hi>and</hi> other Succeſſors of <hi>Alexander</hi> ſucceeded into it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſubdued by him.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Preface prefixed to the fourth Beast, After this I ſaw in the night Viſions, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a fourth Beaſt dreadfull,</hi> verſ. 7. the propoſing of him without a name, as an unknown Monſter; the ſollicitous and curious enquiry of <hi>Daniel</hi> concerning him, ver. 19. the beſtowing of a farre larger &amp; more accurate deſcription upon him then upon the former Beaſts, do plainly argue, That the fourth Kingdom here ſignified is farre more great and wonderful then any of the former, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115824:71"/>therefore cannot be the Kingdom of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leueidae.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Fourthly, <hi>The fourth Beaſt is ſaid to be dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and terrible, and very ſtrong, in compariſon with the Beaſts going before;</hi> having Iron teeth, and Brazen nails, devouring and breaking in peeces, and ſtamping the reſidue under feet. But the Kingdom of the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> was weaker then that of <hi>Alexander,</hi> as is expreſly ſaid, chap. 8.22. and did not devour and deſtroy ſo as the former King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, as entring upon a world ſubdued already by <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, therefore the fourth Kingdom cannot be the Kingdom of the <hi>Seleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidae.</hi> Thou wilt ſay, The fourth Kingdom is thus expreſſed, not in relation to the world, or State generall, but to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, unto which it was more terrible and ſtronger then the former. But it is manifeſt that the Iron ſtrength is the Character of this Kingdome, diſtinguiſhing it in a generall and unlimited compariſon with the Kingdoms going before. To exert in ſome particular place, ſuch as <hi>Judea,</hi> more cruelty, by reaſon of the weakneſſe of the people, and not by reaſon of his own abſolute ſtrength, is not a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reaſon that he ſhould be Characteriſed, and diſtinguiſhed from the others by the character of ſtrength and fearfulneſs, no more verily then the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Inquiſition, or <hi>Phalaris,</hi> or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tyrant, may be ſuperlatively compared in ſtrength with <hi>Cyrus, Alexander, Julius Caeſar,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe more cruell and formidable then they, in reſpect of ſome weak and not reſiſting perſons, over whom without exertion of much ſtrength
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:115824:71"/>they might eaſily exerciſe their tyranny. Again, their ſtrength was not ſo much terrible to the <hi>Jews</hi> as <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> or <hi>Hamans</hi> was; and the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> would have vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves into liberty, and had defended themſelves ſufficiently, had not the <hi>Romans</hi> come upon them, and broken them down at laſt, and the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> together. Laſtly, it is expreſly ſaid, That the fourth Kingdom is thus ſtrong, irony, and terrible, not only in relation to the <hi>Jews,</hi> but alſo to the whole earth, verſ. 23. for it <hi>devours and treads down the whole earth.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="5">5 <hi>Becauſe this Beaſt is ſaid to bee unlike to the Beaſts that were before it;</hi> whereas the Kingdom of the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> was like other Kingdoms. Some ſay, it was unlike in reſpect of the ten Horns; but theſe (as they will have it) are ten ſucceeding Kings, which in kinde and nature is ordinary to all Kingdoms. They ſay it is extraordinary in this reſpect, becauſe ſome of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Kings are mixed in the number. But what ground is there of ſuch a mixture? becauſe (ſay they) they are deſcribed, chap. 11. <hi>Anſ.</hi> But in Chapter eleven is no mention made of ten Horns, and the number there is not adaequately ten; no reaſon to extrude ſome, to intrude others, but rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to reaſon, as <hi>Graſerus</hi> ſheweth.</p>
                           <p n="6">6 <hi>Becauſe the fourth Beaſt hath ten Horns, and a little Horn ariſing after them, by whom three of the former were rooted out, verſ.</hi> 7, 8. How will this agree to the Kingdom of the <hi>Seleucidae?</hi> They ſay, they are ten ſucceding Kings, whereof <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus Epiphanes</hi> is the tenth and laſt, and the

Further, this Prophecy is ſaid to be for many days, Chap. 10. ver. 14. <hi>I am come to make thee underſtand what ſhall befall thy people in the latter days; for yet the Viſion is for many days.</hi> For a long time, chap. 10.1. in the third year of <hi>Cyrus</hi> a thing was revealed to <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the thing was true, but the time appointed was long. Now it is not ordinary in Scripture Phraſe (a thouſand years with God being but as a day) to call ſo ſhort a time as was the time betwixt <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> and <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> many days, a long time.</p>

                           <p>To theſe let me adde ſome few of the very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Arguments (all which would be tedious here
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:115824:73"/>to repeat) that are laid down by Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> in his <hi>Daniels</hi> Viſions, and Prophecies expounded, p. 91. to 97. and again, p. 111. to p. 116. in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to this opinion.</p>
                           <p n="1">1 How (ſaith hee) was <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> a vile Perſon, to whom they gave not the honour of the Kingdom? ſeeing he was the lawfull Son of <hi>Antiochus Magnus,</hi> who (to uſe the words of <hi>Graſerus</hi>) was ſo great even from his Infancy, that then in the world known unto us, there was ſcarce another to be compared with him.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 I require (ſaith he) a ſufficient reaſon, if this be <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> why as many, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more words ſhould be ſpent upon him, then were ſpent upon all the Kings of <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> before him, whereof ſome were farre more notable in exploits then he? If any ſay that it is ſo becauſe he was more notable in afflicting the Saints; I ſtill demand, But why are ſo many words ſpent upon theſe Warlike exploits, that concerned not the Church? Beſides, others before afflicted the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church not alittle, and yet their afflictions are not here mentioned. If his perſecution did exceed, yet why ſhould the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription thereof exceed ſo much, being but ſhort in duration, and not to be compared with thoſe of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> precedent, or thoſe of the <hi>Romans</hi> in the time following? But if it bee ſaid, The reaſon is becauſe <hi>Antiochus</hi> is deſcribed as the type of Antichriſt; I anſwer again; That the Type howſoever muſt be according to truth, and the words of deſcription anſwerable to the things contained therein; the Holy Ghoſt would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:115824:74"/>Antichriſt by a type exceſſively, deſcribed above the verity and proportion thereof.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 He proves at large, that the Warres of this King, and the ſeverall expreſſions the holy Ghoſt uſeth in deſcribing them, verſ. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32. cannot be applied to <hi>Antiochus E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanes,</hi> p. 93, 94, 95.</p>
                           <p n="4">4 What ſhould I ſpeak (ſaith he) of the great afflictions of the Church by ſword, flame, capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and ſpoyl, and that for many days, ver. 33. at certain guſts ſucceeding after interruptions? The Church now and then riſing, and prevailing, verſ. 32, 33, 34. and then at certain fatall revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, ſet by God, expoſed again to fire and ſword, verſ. 35. How can theſe paſſages bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted in the narrow and ſhort perſecutions of <hi>Antiochus?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="5">5 That Phraſe, ver. 36. <hi>He ſhall do what hee liſts,</hi> is uſually applied to irreſiſtable and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable Monarchs, verſ. 3.16. Chap. 8.4. and cannot be applied to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> over whom the <hi>Romans</hi> were ſo imperious, that at the threatning look and command of the Ambaſſador <hi>Popilius,</hi> he was forced to retire out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and leave his prey. Adde to this, That he was inwrapped with many difficulties at home.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, Our aforeſaid Author proveth large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, p. 112, 113, &amp;c. that thoſe Characters, ver. 37, 38, 39. as, <hi>He ſhall not regard the God of his Fathers, neither ſhall he regard the deſire of Women; neither ſhall he regard any God, but ſhall magnifie himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all; He ſhall honour a God whom his Fathers knew not, and a ſtrange God; he ſhall divide the

                           <p>From the whole it appears, That the aforeſaid opinion of the little Horn neither doth, nor will agree to <hi>Daniels</hi> great Prophecy.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly and laſtly, For the <hi>Prophecy it ſelf,</hi> Chap. 8. This opinion of <hi>Antiochus</hi> doth no way agree to it.</p>

                           <p n="2">2 <hi>The Horn here ſpoken of is in reſpect of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings called a little Horn, whereas</hi> Antiochus <hi>was not ſo low at firſt as to be called a little Horn;</hi> for <hi>Antiochus</hi> in reſpect of his Parentage, and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Fortune which he had thereby, was ſo great, even from his infancy, that then in the world there was ſcarce another to bee compared with him, being the undoubted Son of <hi>Antiochus</hi> the Great, and after <hi>Seleucus Philopater</hi> his elder Brother, right Heir of the Kingdoms of <hi>Aſia, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> and <hi>Syria.</hi>

And as for that which <hi>Junius</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth concerning his taking of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> if that were true, yet would it little help his cauſe, ſeeing it is manifeſt that his Father <hi>Antiochus</hi> did not leſs exploits againſt <hi>AEgypt.</hi> Indeed <hi>Antiochus Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes</hi> did the ſecond time invade <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but with ſuch a ſucceſſe that he got more diſhonour then honour thereby. Neither in other Wars was he ſo happy and fortunate, that therein he might be ſo farre preferred above his Anceſtors.

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:115824:77"/>twelfth Chapters terminates at, being not the end of <hi>Antiochus</hi> rage, but of the Fourth Monarchy; therefore not <hi>Antiochus</hi> rage, but the end of the Fourth Monarchy is alſo the point of time with which the Prophecy, chap. 8. doth likewiſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate.</p>
                           <p n="8">8 Daniel <hi>is commanded to shut up the Viſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was to be for many days,</hi> verſ. 26. But as it is not likely, that the Angel would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Daniel</hi> to ſhut up the Viſion, but rather have given a contrary command, as to <hi>Iohn,</hi> Rev. 22.10. <hi>Seal not the ſayings of the Prophecy of this Book, for the time is at hand;</hi> in caſe the fulfilling of it had been ſo near as the times of <hi>Antiochus E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanes;</hi> ſo cannot two thouſand three hundred Natural days, no nor the whole of the time from the day <hi>Daniel</hi> had this Viſion, to the utmoſt point of <hi>Antiochus</hi> rage, be called in the Phraſe of the Holy Ghoſt, who (as I have ſaid before) calls a long time ſhort, many days.</p>
                           <p>The concluſion from the whole, is, <hi>That that opinion which makes application of this Prophecy, chap.</hi> 8. <hi>to</hi> Antiochus Epiphanes, <hi>interpreting the two thouſand three hundred years of the time of his rage againſt the</hi> Jews, <hi>neither doth nor will agree to any one of</hi> Daniels <hi>four Prophecies.</hi>

                           <p>ERe I proceed, I ſhall here by way of digreſſion lay down my own thoughts concerning the little Horn, <hi>chap.</hi> 8, 9. upon whom the whole ſtreſſe of the Controverſie lies.</p>
                           <pb n="121" facs="tcp:115824:77"/>
                           <p>All thoſe that I have ſeen, who differ from the common opinion of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> will have this little Horn to be the very ſame with that Chap. 7. and accordingly ſome apply it to the Romiſh Antichriſt, ſome to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> ſome to the <hi>Norman</hi> Race, &amp;c. The two laſt opinions of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and the <hi>Norman</hi> Race, I have diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before, and that throughout all the Propheſies of <hi>Daniel.</hi> The firſt which interprets it of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Antichriſt is the moſt colourable, becauſe its clear the little Horn, Chap. 7. is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of him, and alſo a large and full deſcription of Antichriſt comes under this little Horn. To this therefore onely I ſhall here oppoſe, and that by laying down my own opinion, which is,</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>That the little Horn,</hi> Chap. 8. <hi>is not Antichrists Kingdome only, but the whole body of the fourth, or Roman Monarchy,</hi> which is clear,</p>
                           <p n="1">1 Becauſe <hi>in each of</hi> Daniels <hi>other Propheſies we have the Roman Monarchy ſet forth in its two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold eſtate.</hi> 1 <hi>In its pure Civil ſtate.</hi> 2 <hi>In its, mixt Antichristian ſtate, as I have before proved,</hi> Part. 2. Chap. 4. Sect. 2. <hi>But if the little Horn in this Chapter ſignifie Antichrists Kingdome only, then in this Propheſie we have the Roman Monarchy deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed only in its ſecond ſtate, and ſo this Propheſie is made to differ from the other three;</hi> Yea by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence many hundred years.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 Becauſe <hi>the riſe of this little Horn in the latter time of the Grecian Monarchy</hi> ſhould here be leaped over, which is not in any of the other Propheſies, verſ. 23. <hi>And in the latter time of their Kingdome, a King of fierce countenance ſhall
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:115824:78"/>ſtand up.</hi> What Kingdome is this? <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Kingdome of the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſpoken of verſ. 22. which after <hi>Alexanders</hi> death was broken and divided into four Kingdomes. This no wayes agrees to Antichriſt, whoſe riſe was not till ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred years after the diſſolution of the third or <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchy, but it punctually agrees to the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, which had its riſe (according to the very words) in the latter time of the divided <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchy.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 <hi>Becauſe the riſe of this little Horn is out of one of the four Horns of the Grecian Monarchy,</hi> verſ. 9. <hi>And out of one of them</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> of the four Horns, verſ. 8.) <hi>came forth a little Horn.</hi> This cannot be applied to Antichriſt who roſe out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, not the <hi>Grecian.</hi> But it agrees well to the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, which conſider it as it was a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy in the account of the Holy Ghoſt here in <hi>Daniel;</hi> for by the way obſerve this Rule, <hi>That the Holy Ghoſt accounts none of the Kingdomes ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another to be Monarchies, till they had ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up the whole, or ſome conſiderable part of the foregoing Monarchy;</hi> therefore though <hi>Cyrus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the taking of <hi>Babylon</hi> had obtained great Conqueſts, yet his Monarchy in <hi>Daniels</hi> ſenſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins thence. <hi>Alexander</hi> likewiſe had done great exploits before he encountred <hi>Darius,</hi> yet his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy begins from his overthrow of him. In like manner, we are to reckon the beginning of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, from that time when it firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to bring under the <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchy, which was when it did ſubdue to it ſelf the Kingdome of <hi>Macedon</hi> (one of the four Horns, into which the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:115824:78"/>
                              <hi>Grecian</hi> Kingdome after <hi>Alexanders</hi> death was divided) when the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Kingdome (which formerly had been the Seat of the third Monarchy) was turned into a <hi>Roman</hi> Province, then began the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, from which time the ſame did daily increaſe till in the end by degrees one after another, it ſwallowed up the other Horns alſo.</p>
                           <p>Now obſerve the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy may well be ſaid to riſe out of one of the four Horns of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchy in regard that that Kingdome, which in the account of the Holy Ghoſt before was no Monarchy by ſwallowing up the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Macedon</hi> (the Seat of the former Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy) now takes place of it, and becomes a Monarchy; and therefore many make obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that remarkable Ecclipſe of the Moon, which was total, and happened the night before that fatal overthrow of <hi>Perſius</hi> by <hi>Aemylius</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſul, through which the <hi>Macedonian</hi> kingdome was loſt, as a Prognoſtication of this wonderful change.</p>
                           <p n="4">4 Becauſe <hi>this Horn in its firſt riſe was a little Horn, which</hi> fitly agrees to the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, conſider it either, firſt as it became a Monarchy (as I ſaid even now) by ſubduing to it ſelf the Kingdome of <hi>Macedon,</hi> which (though it had been the ancient Seat of the third Monarchy, yet) comparatively with ſome other of the four Horns in the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire (<hi>viz.</hi> the Kingdomes of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> which were more potent then that of <hi>Macedon</hi>) it was but a little Horn.</p>
                           <p>Or ſecondly, if we conſider the manner of the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:115824:79"/>
                              <hi>Romans</hi> growth as they were a Monarchy, which was different from the growth of all the former Monarchies; For the former Monarchies had their perfection in a manner the firſt day they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Monarchies; but the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy is a Monarchy whilſt yet it is little and more imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and afterwards by a gradual growth through continuance of time it attains perfection. <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſwallows up the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy, <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> as it were at a mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and in ſo doing, theſe Monarchies are at the top, arrive to their perfect ſtature the firſt day of their birth: But the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy otherwiſe, it comes creeping on (as 'twere unſeen) and by little and little encroacheth upon the <hi>Grecian</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, till in the end it hath devoured all.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, it ſwallows up the little Kingdome of <hi>Macedon;</hi> by this it becomes a Monarchy; then about a hundred yeers after, it ſwallows up the Kingdome of <hi>Syria,</hi> and makes a Province of that; then ſometime after the Kingdome of <hi>Egypt,</hi> then <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> and the Countries adjacent, making them Provinces, and ſo by degrees it ſwallows up the whole <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchy; ſo that indeed we may ſay the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy comparatively, with what it grew to through continuance of time, was in its firſt birth but an Infant, and therefore is well called a little Horn.</p>
                           <p>This gradual growth of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy (take it in its firſt, or ſecond ſtate, for herein one anſwers to the other, the growth of both is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual) is livelily ſet forth by the terme <hi>Waxing, it waxed great towards the South, &amp;c, and it waxed
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:115824:79"/>great, even to the hoſt of Heaven,</hi> verſ. 10. which word notes a gradual increaſe, whereas the growth of the other Monarchies was (as I have ſaid) ſudden.</p>
                           <p>Furthermore, whereas this waxing great of this little Horn in its firſt ſtate is ſaid to be <hi>TO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WARDS</hi> the South, and <hi>TOWARDS</hi> the Eaſt, and <hi>TOWARDS</hi> the pleaſant Land, it excellently ſets forth the exploits of the <hi>Romans</hi> after they had ſubdued the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Kingdome; For hereupon they aſſault the Kingdomes of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> whereof one lay towards the Eaſt of <hi>Macedon,</hi> or if you will rather of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> the other the South; and withall they invade <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which is here cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the pleaſant Land. So that in a word, a more accurate deſcription of the firſt riſe, and growth of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy (according to what Hiſtories record hereof) cannot be given, then is here in this Viſion of <hi>Daniel</hi> laid down in but a Line or two.</p>
                           <p n="5">5 Becauſe <hi>this Horn though little in its firſt riſe, yet doth it in time wax exceeding great,</hi> verſ. 9. greater then any of the Kingdomes that had been before it, exceeding them all, which agrees not to Antichriſts Kingdome, but exactly to what we have of the fourth Monarchy, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.40. Chap. 7.7.</p>
                           <p n="6">6 Becauſe <hi>the twofold waxing great of this little Horn, excellently ſets forth the twofold ſtate of the Roman Monarchy.</hi> 1 As a Civil ſtate onely, in which ſtate it ſubdues Nations to it ſelf, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the Land of <hi>Canaan; it waxed exceeding
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:115824:80"/>great towards the South, and towards the Eaſt, and towards the pleaſant land.</hi> 2 As a Mixt ſtate, or a Civil and Eccleſiaſtical ſtate both, in which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod the great thing it doth, is, to make war with the Saints, and tread underfoot the Holy City, verſ. 10. <hi>And it waxed great even to the hoſt of Heaven, and it caſt down ſome of the hoſt, and of the ſtars to the ground, and ſtamped upon them.</hi> To this twofold waxing great doth moſt excellently agree that double title given afterwards to this fourth King, verſ. 23. 1 <hi>A King of fierce countenance,</hi> ſuch is the fourth Kingdome, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.40. and the fourth Beaſt, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.7. 2 <hi>Underſtanding dark ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,</hi> ſuch is the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, at leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to abundance of wiſdome, learning, and high ſpeculations in its ſecond ſtate under Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</p>
                           <p>This twofold waxing great, and this double title, will agree to no opinion (neither to that of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> nor that of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> nor that of the Romiſh Antichriſt, nor that of <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> or the <hi>Norman</hi> Race in general) as it doth to this.</p>
                           <p>I conclude, therefore that the little Horn here mentioned, is the whole body of the fourth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, and not the ſame in its ſecond ſtate only.</p>
                           <p>Now the Roman Monarchy is here called <hi>the little Horn,</hi> the name before given to Antichriſt, Chap. 7. for one, or both theſe Reaſons.</p>
                           <p n="1">1 Becauſe <hi>there is a likelihood in their riſe.</hi> The Roman Monarchy (as I have ſaid) when it firſt began to creep up, was but little, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Daniel,</hi> Chap. 7.7. beholds the fourth Beaſt
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:115824:80"/>creeping up in the night viſions, <hi>i.e.</hi> this Beaſt was obſcure, and in a manner unſeen at firſt, none dreamed he would grow ſo terrible a Beaſt, ſuch was Antichriſt, and for this reaſon called <hi>the little Horn</hi> Chap. 7. Or</p>
                           <p n="2">2 Becauſe <hi>Antichriſt in the laſt dayes was to weild the Scepter in this Monarchy, and the ſequel of the Propheſie was to go on chiefly upon him:</hi> And hence obſerve, we have in the Viſion and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication both, onely a word (as it were to bring on the other) of the Civil ſtate of the fourth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, the main of the Propheſie looking to its Antichriſtian ſtate. Now as this is (I ſuppoſe) the very cauſe and ground of their miſtake who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret all this of Antichriſts Kingdome onely; ſo may it be the reaſon, why the name proper to Antichriſt, ſhould here be given to the whole Monarchy, becauſe his Kingdome being a part of that Monarchy, was the thing chiefly in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Diſcourſe to be inſiſted on.</p>
                           <p>What I have ſaid confirms our former opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, <hi>that this Propheſie belongs not to</hi> Antiochus Epiphanes, <hi>but another thing; and conſequently the two thouſand and three hundred dayes are not to be underſtood of Natural dayes, but Prophetical.</hi>

                           <p>Having already proved that the two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand three hundred dayes cannot be natural dayes, but muſt be Prophetical; In the next place, a Queſtion will ariſe, whether by the two thouſand three hundred dayes we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:115824:81"/>ſo many dayes or years compleat?</p>
                           <p>A very worthy and learned Author, reading, according to the Hebrew, two thouſand and three hundred mornings and evenings, which make but half ſo many compleat dayes, will have but half ſo many dayes (at moſt) viz. one thouſand, one hundred and fifty, to he here accounted upon.</p>
                           <p>But to this opinion I muſt give my diſſent.</p>
                           <p n="1">1 Becauſe <hi>this way of computing by morning and evening a part, is no where elſe found in all the Prophets.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="2">2 Becauſe <hi>its the ordinary Scripture-phraſe to put morning and evening for one day,</hi> Gen. 1.5. <hi>the evening and the morning were the firſt day,</hi> verſ. 8. <hi>the evening and the morning were the ſecond day,</hi> verſ. 13.19.23.31. And therefore its more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to Scripture-phraſe to conceive that the Holy Ghoſt by two thouſand and three hundred mornings and evenings, doth intend ſo many compleat dayes, then that he ſhould mean onely ſo many mornings and evenings, which make but half the number of dayes.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 Becauſe <hi>by this Computation the very Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie it ſelf becomes uſeleſs to us, who cannot from it make up any account;</hi> For untill ſome Head is found out where we are to begin, there can be no ſupputation of years. Now I ask, (if the two thouſand and three hundred years are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of but half ſo many years, <hi>viz.</hi> one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, one hundred and fifty) Where are we to begin them? If we begin from the time <hi>Daniel</hi> had his Viſion, how will one thouſand, one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:115824:81"/>and fifty years bring us thence to the time of the end, when as two thouſand and two hundred years and upwards are paſſed already ſince that time, and yet the end is not.</p>
                           <p>If we ſhall begin lower (as we muſt by above a thouſand years) let the head of our account be ſhewed in the Text. <hi>Daniel</hi> in all his other my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Numbers hath ſtill ſome clear head of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count laid down: His ſeventy weeks have for their Head the going forth of the Commandement to reſtore and build <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Dan. 9.25. His one thouſand two hundred and ninety, and his one thouſand three hundred thirty and five, have for their Head the taking away of the daily ſacrifice, and ſetting up of the abomination that maketh deſolate, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.11, 12. Now let a Head of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count be ſhewed in the Text for this. If it be ſaid, It is implied, though not expreſſed, verſ. 13. to be the taking away of the daily ſacrifice, trampling the Sanctuary, and Hoſt underfoot. <hi>Anſ.</hi> If this be the Head of account, then muſt the Head of this account, and the Head of the one thouſand three hundred thirty and five dayes, Chap. 12. be one and the ſame; for that is the taking away of the daily ſacrifice. And if ſo, then let a ſufficient reaſon be given to reconcile theſe places, why the account there (which begins with this) ſhould have one hundred eighty and five dayes or years more in it, then this here; for who reckons ſhall find the one thouſand three hundred thirty five to have in it ſo many years more then one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, one hundred and fifty, eſpecially conſidering too that the one thouſand two hundred and thirty
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:115824:82"/>dayes, and the one thouſand three hundred thirty five dayes, do both end in the full reſtauration of the Church, and through-cleanſing of the Sanctuary, as is clear from the ſcope of either Propheſie. If it be ſaid, ſome other taking away of the daily ſacrifice is here to be ſought for as Head to this Number, then that which was in <hi>Julians</hi> dayes. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Grant it, yet muſt the time when this was done, be ſo ſtated as that the one thouſand one hundred and fifty years may concur in their end with the one thouſand three hundred thirty and five years; For the Propheſie Chap. 8. and that Chap. 12. bring us both to one and the ſame point, <hi>viz.</hi> the laſt, moſt full, and glorious reſtitution of the Church, where either number muſt expire. This taken into conſideration, I ſay no more; Let the time be ſtated.</p>
                           <p n="4">4 Becauſe <hi>we have a ſpecial mark ſet upon this Number of two thouſand and three hundred dayes (which is not upon any other number in all</hi> Daniel, <hi>or the</hi> Revelations) <hi>to give us to underſtand that the time ſhall be long,</hi> v. 26. <hi>And the Viſion of the evening and morning</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> of the two thouſand and three hundred dayes, verſ. 14. ſet forth by ſo many evenings and mornings) which was told, is true; wherefore ſhut thou up the Viſion, for it (<hi>i.e.</hi> the Viſion of the evening and morning, which as it was the laſt thing in the Viſion, ſo is it here in the Interpretation) <hi>ſhall be for many dayes.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now obſerve, the like is not ſaid of any other myſtical Number, neither of the two and forty months, nor of the one thouſand two hundred
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:115824:82"/>and ſixty dayes, nor of the one thouſand two hundred and ninety, the one thouſand three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thirty and five, that it ſhould be for many dayes. Indeed <hi>Daniels</hi> laſt Viſion, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in it his one thouſand two hundred and ninety dayes, hath this ſaid of it, It ſhall be for many dayes Chapt. 10.14. but let it be noted, that theſe words have not reference to the one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred and ninety, the one thouſand three hundred thirty and five dayes afterwards ſpoken off, but rather to the time of the Viſion it ſelf, which was in the third year of <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> Chap. 10.1. and this was neer a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years higher then the Head of the one thouſand two hundred and ninety, the one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand three hundred thirty and five dayes; and therefore well may the Viſion it ſelf, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the one thouſand three hundred thirty and five years, and over and above almoſt a thouſand more, (not full forty wanting of the number) be called a Viſion for many dayes or years. But now let it be ſhewed of any other number (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this of the two thouſand and three hundred) where we have any ſuch mark ſet upon the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it ſelf, That it ſhould be for many dayes, as we have expreſly here the mark ſet upon the number it ſelf, The Viſion of the evening and and morning (or the two thouſand and three hundred mornings and evenings) is true; therefore ſhut it up, for it ſhall be for many dayes.</p>
                           <p>Now certainly we can from hence learn no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe then that the two thouſand and three
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115824:83"/>hundred is a larger Epock then either the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty, the one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred and ninety, or the one thouſand three hundred thirty and five (which are the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt beſides it that we read of) for neither of them doth the Lord himſelf (with whom a thouſand years is as a day) count long, or ſet a mark upon, that we ſhould account them ſo; but this the Holy Ghoſt hath noted down as a long time, and marked it out that we might ſo look upon it; but now according to the foregoing account which reckons onely one thouſand one hundred and fifty years, it ſhould be a hundred and ten yeers ſhorter then the leaſt, and ſhorteſt of theſe; which how it will agree to this note here left us by the Holy Ghoſt, to give us ſpecial light and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in things, I do not ſee.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, I ſhall ſay no more; <hi>The Labyrinth, the worthy Author of this opinion ſeems to be in,</hi> not knowing whether he may reckon one morning and one evening for a day, and ſo of two thouſand three hundred mornings and evenings, make one thouſand one hundred and fifty dayes or years; or whether he ſhould reckon two evenings and two mornings for one day, ſo numbring the dayes and years (which he alſo doth, making two divers reckonings) according to the fourth part of the two thouſand three hundred evenings and mornings, which makes five hundred ſeventy five dayes or years; <hi>appears to me to be confutation ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient of that opinion;</hi> which ſhould we follow it, yet concludes nothing certain.</p>
                           <p>The Concluſion then is, <hi>That by the two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:115824:83"/>three hundred dayes, we are to underſtand two thouſand three hundred dayes or years compleat.</hi>

                           <p>The time of the Viſion bears date the third year of the Reign of King <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> verſ. 1.</p>
                           <p>This year was the laſt year of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy; and to go ſtrictly to the time of the Viſion, it was in the latter part of the year, after <hi>Babylon</hi> was taken, <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> ſlain, and the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian</hi> Monarchy tranſlated to the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians;</hi> as the learned and judicious Dr. <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot</hi> in his Harmony of the Old Teſtament upon <hi>Daniel</hi> the eighth hath clearly proved; his words are theſe; <hi>The firſt and ſecond verſes of this Chapter plainly ſhew that</hi> Belſhazzar <hi>reigned but three years; for it telleth that in the third of</hi> Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar, Daniel <hi>was in</hi> Shuſan, <hi>the Royal City of</hi> Perſia. <hi>It cannot be imagined, he was there in</hi> Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzars <hi>life time, for his preferment and reſidence was in</hi> Babylon, <hi>till</hi> Babylon <hi>fell; but his coming thither, was by the tranſporting of him thither by the</hi> Perſian <hi>Monarch, after he had conquered</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, <hi>who as it appeareth by</hi> verſ. 27. <hi>had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred him there, and intereſſed him in the Kings employment.

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:115824:84"/>of</hi> Belſhazzar, <hi>purpoſely that we might learn to give the firſt year of</hi> Cyrus <hi>its proper Date,</hi> i. e. <hi>reckon the firſt year of</hi> Cyrus <hi>and</hi> Darius, <hi>not the year that</hi> Babylon <hi>fell, but the year after; and partly that we may obſerve how that in the very year the</hi> Medes <hi>and</hi> Perſians <hi>deſtroy</hi> Babel, <hi>the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth to</hi> Daniel <hi>the deſtruction of the</hi> Medes <hi>and</hi> Perſians, <hi>and the Monarchies after them.</hi> Hitherto Dr. <hi>Lightfoot.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Give me leave to adde, as a farther explication, That that Kings buſineſſe, which verſ. 27. <hi>Daniel</hi> is ſaid to do, is no way likely to be <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> who neither knew <hi>Daniel,</hi> nor had <hi>Daniel</hi> to do with him, as the words, Chap. 5. verſ. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. ſeem to import; but very likely to be <hi>Darius,</hi> who upon the taking of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſet Preſidents over the Kingdome, or Empire, of which <hi>Daniel</hi> was firſt, Chap. 6.1, 2. And by reaſon of the nature of his employment, it was meet his abode ſhould be in the Royal City of the Empire where he might better at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it then he could elſewhere. Now this was not <hi>Babylon,</hi> but <hi>Shuſhan,</hi> as appears, <hi>Eſther</hi> 1.2. where therefore <hi>Daniel</hi> now was, not Viſionally (as ſay ſome) but really and perſonally, as is clear from verſ. 2. <hi>And I ſaw in a Viſion (and it came to paſſe when I ſaw, that I was at</hi> Shuſhan <hi>in the Palace, which is in the Province of</hi> Elam) <hi>and I ſaw in a Viſion, and I was by the River of</hi> Ulai.</p>
                           <p>Had <hi>Daniel</hi> been in the place here mentioned Viſionally only, he would never have ſpoken of two places; for Viſionally how could he ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at <hi>Shuſhan,</hi> in the Palace, and alſo by the River
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:115824:85"/>of <hi>Ulai</hi> at the ſame time, beholding the ſame Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; the meaning therefore undoubtedly is, <hi>Daniel</hi> by vertue of his reſidence at the time he ſaw this Viſion, was at <hi>Shuſhan</hi> in the Palace; but locally he was either walking abroad to pray, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate, refreſh himſelf, &amp;c. by the River of <hi>Ulai;</hi> as when he ſaw his great Viſion, Chap. 10. he was by the River <hi>Hiddekel,</hi> verſ. 4. and this not Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally, but really, for he had company with him, verſ. 7.8. ſo was <hi>Daniel</hi> at this time really and perſonally by a River called <hi>Ulai,</hi> neer adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (in all probability) to <hi>Shuſhan</hi> the Palace, where he ſaw this Viſion. Now what made <hi>Daniel</hi> there, if at the time of this Viſion <hi>Babylon</hi> were not taken? It muſt therefore be that <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> was now taken, and the Monarchy tranſlated, although the Viſion bears date (for the reaſons given by Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi>) the third of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now it being ſo that <hi>Belſhazzars</hi> third was the laſt yeer of the <hi>Babylon an</hi> Monarchy, and conſequently <hi>Cyrus</hi> firſt, the very next year, our beginning of the two thouſand and three hundred dayes, agrees moſt fitly to the time of the Viſion; for obſerve the third of <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> being the current year, its neceſſary therefore that we do not bring that into our account, but let it fall: The very firſt year therefore that we either may, or can begin our account upon, is <hi>Cyrus</hi> firſt, which begun with the beginning of the following year; and therefore to begin the two thouſand three hundred dayes, with the firſt of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> agrees moſt excellently both to the matter, and the time of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:115824:85"/>the Viſion. This therefore I conclude to be the only true beginning.</p>

                           <p>But ere I can proceed farther, one thing there is ſomewhat needful to be enquired into, <hi>viz.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no is the ſecond Monarchy to take its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning (as I have ſaid) from the firſt year of <hi>Cyrus</hi> the <hi>Perſian;</hi> or whether had it not its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſome years before under <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede?</hi> The ground of this Queſtion is becauſe <hi>Daniel</hi> makes mention of one <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Median</hi> taking the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy from <hi>Belſhazzer,</hi> Dan. 5.30, 31. and alſo ſpeaks of him as a perſon diſtinct from <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Dan. 6.28.</p>
                           <p>Some to ſalve this difficulty, will have this <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> the <hi>Mede</hi> to be King of the <hi>Babylonians</hi> not by Conqueſt, but by Election: And their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture upon this buſineſſe runs thus. That King <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> was ſlain the night after his great Feaſt, by a conſpiracy of thoſe of his friends that he called to his Banquet; amongſt theſe conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors this <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede</hi> was one, who being a man ancient, wiſe, and of great authority among the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> they (though he were a <hi>Mede</hi> and a ſtranger, yet) to avoid contentions for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome (<hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Line being ended in <hi>Belſhazzar</hi>) confer it on him. Thoſe of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion give to this <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede,</hi> ſome ſeventeen, ſome eighteen yeers.</p>
                           <p>Now although this opinion (as laid down by the Authors of it) hurt not us greatly, becauſe
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:115824:86"/>the time they allow to this <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede,</hi> they give to the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy, (reckoning the ſeventeen years of his Reign into the ſeventy of the Captivity) and not to the <hi>Perſian,</hi> which they with one mouth confeſſe began with the firſt of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who (ſay they) took the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy not from <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> but from this <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede;</hi> yet becauſe if once we grant it, that the Reign of this <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede</hi> was diſtinct in regard of time from the Reign of <hi>Cyrus</hi> the <hi>Perſian,</hi> there will be then force enough in <hi>Daniel</hi> to beat us, yea and all Chronologers off their ground, while they account the firſt year of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to be the firſt year of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy; I ſhall not therefore let the opinion paſſe by without an examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                           <p>And although it were enough to deſtroy the credit of it, to ſay, That the whole of the ſtory this opinion is founded upon, is but pure conjecture, there being not one tittle in the whole Scripture to bring us to the belief of ſuch a thing; yet ſhall I not inſiſt upon that, but rather prove how that this opinion doth not onely want Scripture warrant, but manifeſtly fights with the Scripture. For it is moſt evident from <hi>Daniel,</hi> that <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede</hi> there mentioned, did Reign in the beginning of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy, and not (as ſaith this Opinion) in the end of the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Reaſons of this are:</p>
                           <p n="1">1 Becauſe <hi>Daniel</hi> (as I have proved before) <hi>was in that very year which is called</hi> Belſhazzars <hi>third, in</hi> Shuſhan, <hi>the Royal City of</hi> Perſia: Now
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:115824:86"/>what made <hi>Daniel</hi> there, if in this very year the Monarchy were not tranſlated? if the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy were now tranſlated, where ſhall we find room for the ſeventeen or eighteen yeers of its continuance afterwards?</p>
                           <p>It may be ſaid <hi>Daniel</hi> was in <hi>Shuſhan</hi> by the power and authority of <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede,</hi> who (though he were now elected King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> yet) had ſtill great power at home, and by vertue of that ſettles and prefers <hi>Daniel</hi> in <hi>Shuſhan.</hi>

Now ſay the Authors of this opinion, <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> was a profeſſed enemy to this <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede,</hi> and did in the end take the Kingdome of <hi>Babylon</hi> from him.

                           <p n="2">2 Becauſe <hi>this</hi> Darius <hi>the</hi> Mede <hi>did rule by the Laws of the</hi> Medes <hi>and</hi> Perſians, as is clear, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. verſ. 8, 12, 15. he muſt therefore belong to the times of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy, and not of the <hi>Babylonian;</hi> For who can think the <hi>Babylonians</hi> were ſo ſtupid, ſuch Fools and Mad-men, as to ſuffer a King, a ſtranger, who came in amongſt
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:115824:87"/>them not by any Conqueſt, or power that he had to conquer them, but (as ſaith this opinion) by their free choice, which was a matter of curteſie towards him? I ſay, to ſuffer ſuch a one to rule abſolutely by the Laws of his own Country, and not rather by theirs, is a thing that we cannot eaſily imagine that any other, unleſſe very Fools or Mad-men (in ſuch a caſe) would conſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 Becauſe <hi>it appears from the faith and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency of</hi> Daniel, <hi>and his urging preſent deliverance ſo much as he doth in that prayer of his</hi> Chap. 9. (which prayer was made in the firſt year of this <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede</hi> as verſ. 1. tells us) <hi>that</hi> Daniel <hi>did now look upon the ſeveny years as run out</hi> (which alſo he ſeems to intimate verſ. 2.) <hi>at this time of his praying;</hi> which conſideration puts life, courage, faith, boldneſſe into him. But now according to this opinion there ſhould be ſeventeen or eighteen years of the ſeventy yet to expire; which ſurely in caſe <hi>Daniel</hi> had ſo looked upon it, it would have been a great cooling to his ſpirit, a quenching to his faith, ſo as he could never have urged (as he doth, verſ. 16, 17.) <hi>a preſent turning away of Gods anger, cauſing his face to ſhine upon them; nor would he ever have pleaded</hi> (as he doth, verſ. 19.) <hi>defer not for thine own ſake, O my God;</hi> For how could he with faith have uttered thoſe words, defer not, if he had looked upon the time of their deliverance to be remote ſeventeen, or eighteen yeers?</p>
                           <p n="4">4 Becauſe <hi>the Scripture is clear and punctual that the</hi> Babylonian <hi>Monarchy ended in</hi> Belſhazzar,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:115824:87"/>
                              <hi>therefore may we not look for any</hi> Darius <hi>to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him in that Monarchy.</hi> This we have, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.26. <hi>God hath numbred thy Kingdome and finiſhed it.</hi> Theſe words are not to be referred to the Kingdome of <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> in particular, but to the whole <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy (called <hi>Belſhazzars</hi> Kingdome, becauſe he now ſwayed the Scepter in it) the continuance whereof was numbred by God, or meaſured out to be ſeventy years, <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.11, 12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.10. which determined time was now expired or finiſhed, as the Text tells us; Therefore no room is left for a <hi>Darius</hi> to ſucceed in this Monarchy.</p>
                           <p n="5">5 Becauſe <hi>Belſhazzars Kingdome is divided, when he loſeth it, betwixt the</hi> Medes <hi>and the</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, Dan. 5.28. <hi>Thy Kingdome is divided, and given to the</hi> Medes <hi>and</hi> Perſians; but according to this opinion, if <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede,</hi> as a King elected did firſt poſſeſſe the whole, and after him <hi>Cyrus</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> by Conqueſt gain the whole, what diviſion were there?

                           <p n="6">6 Becauſe <hi>the words of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Dan. 11.1. <hi>import as much as if that this</hi> Darius <hi>the</hi> Mede <hi>had been uſed by God in the doing ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſervice for him and his people.</hi> Alſo v. 3. <hi>in the firſt year of</hi> Darius <hi>the</hi> Mede, <hi>even I ſtood up to confirm and ſtrengthen him.</hi> Gods ſtanding up to confirm and ſtrengthen <hi>Darius</hi> in the firſt year of his Reign is an Argument of ſome remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:115824:88"/>work that was done for God in this year: Now if we place <hi>Darius</hi> firſt year with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy, its evident enough what this work was, namely, the giving way to <hi>Iſraels</hi> return out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the making him willing to that work, which outwardly might ſeem to his loſſe and diſadvantage; but in caſe we place <hi>Darius</hi> firſt year (as doth this opinion) ſixteen or ſeventeen years before the expiration of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy, let it be ſhewn from Scripture, what that eminent peece of ſervice was, that was done for God in that year.</p>
                           <p>From the whole I conclude, <hi>That</hi> Darius <hi>the</hi> Mede <hi>ſpoken of by</hi> Daniel, <hi>did not reign in the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time of the</hi> Babylonian <hi>Monarchy, but in the beginning of the</hi> Perſian.</p>
                           <p>But it may be ſaid, If ſo, then of neceſſity muſt we begin the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy not with the firſt of <hi>Cyrus</hi> (as before) but with the firſt year of <hi>Darius;</hi> and if ſo, then is not the beginning of the two thouſand three hundred dayes which (I have ſaid) begins with the firſt of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> ſtated aright.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſw.</hi> It doth not follow, For though it is confeſſed that <hi>Darius</hi> did reign in the beginning of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy, yet doth it not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow that <hi>Cyrus</hi> did not, unleſſe it could be proved that theſe two did ſucceed each other, which cannot be from Scripture, but rather the contrary is manifeſt, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi> were contemporaries, and indeed Co-partners in the Kingdome of <hi>Babylon</hi> after the ſame was
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:115824:88"/>taken. For let it be conſidered, that the taking of <hi>Babylon</hi> was not an act performed by <hi>Cyrus</hi> alone, nor by <hi>Darius</hi> alone, but it was their joynt act; they two (one being King of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> the other of the <hi>Medes;</hi> and as Hiſtories report, allyed the one to the other) joyn forces, and with their united ſtrength march up againſt <hi>Babylon,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege it, take it. And this is clearly the mind of the Scripture, and that opinion only which with Scripture approbation will ſtand. For,</p>
                           <p n="1">1 <hi>The Scripture attributes the taking of</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon <hi>to either of them, as being their joynt act.</hi> It is attributed to <hi>Darius,</hi> Dan. 5.31. to <hi>Cyrus</hi> Iſa. 45.1, 2, 3. which is a clear Propheſie of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> his taking <hi>Babylon.</hi> To ſay (as ſome) that <hi>Cyrus</hi> in the taking of <hi>Babylon</hi> did act as Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Army under <hi>Darius,</hi> is not only a thing without Scripture-warrant, but a thing in it ſelf very incredible, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Cyrus</hi> who (as all Hiſtories report) had before the taking of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> reigned ſome years as King among the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> and was for his warlike exploits and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories the moſt famous man then living, having alſo hitherto in his way met with no check or frown of Providence, ſhould upon the ſudden in the midſt of all his Trophies and Victories, come down from being a King, to be General only under another.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 <hi>The Propheſie we are now upon,</hi> Dan. 8. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the beginning of the ſecond Monarchy, doth plainly hold forth this.</hi> For obſerve it, as the third Monarchy of the <hi>Grecian</hi> is in the riſe of it deſcribed by a <hi>He-goat having one Horn,</hi> verſ. 5.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:115824:89"/>which Horn was <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great; ſo the riſe of the ſecond Monarchy of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> is deſcribed by a <hi>Ram having two Horns,</hi> verſ. 3. which two Horns are interpreted, the Kings of <hi>Media</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> verſ. 20. Now as theſe two horns were both upon the Ram toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at the time of his puſhing againſt the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian</hi> Monarchy; for otherwiſe, why is he deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed as puſhing with two horns? ſo muſt we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede</hi> with their united ſtrength did puſh againſt the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and overthrowing them did accordingly (untill by <hi>Darius</hi> death, the Monarchy fell to <hi>Cyrus</hi> alone) Reign toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

Nay, let me ſay, it muſt needs be ſo, that the ſeventy years did expire with the firſt year of <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede,</hi> when <hi>Babylon</hi> was taken, and ſo conſequently <hi>Darius</hi> firſt year, and <hi>Cyrus</hi> firſt, but one and the ſame year, becauſe the forequoted Propheſie, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29. is clear, that after ſeventy years were expired, <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould return from <hi>Babylon:</hi> And <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.11, 12. ſpeaks it yet more clearly, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould ſerve the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> but ſeventy years, which ſo ſoon as accompliſhed, God would
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115824:90"/>puniſh the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and deliver them: Whence I conclude, that the ſeventy years are not to be extended any further then the time that <hi>Iſrael</hi> did ſerve <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the time that <hi>Babylon</hi> was puniſhed of God: But <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſerved <hi>Babylon</hi> no longer then the firſt year of <hi>Darius;</hi> for with his taking the Kingdome (as our former Reaſons prove) the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy ended, if we ſhould therefore ſuppoſe them in ſervitude afterwards, it muſt be to the <hi>Medes,</hi> not the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylontans;</hi> and alſo <hi>Babylon</hi> was ſufficiently puniſhed of God, when the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy was tranſlated to another people; both which things having their plenary accompliſhment in the firſt year of <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede,</hi> therefore with that year muſt the ſeventy years of neceſſity expire; and if ſo, then muſt the firſt year of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> the <hi>Mede</hi> be alſo the firſt year of <hi>Cyrus</hi> the <hi>Perſian,</hi> in which <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſet free; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they had remained in Captivity above ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty years. If therefore the firſt year of <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede,</hi> and the firſt of <hi>Cyrus</hi> the <hi>Perſian,</hi> were one and the ſame year, then of neceſſity muſt their Reign be together; and therefore (I take it) that thoſe words, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.28. ſpeak of <hi>Darius</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi> as Co-reigners, and not as Reigning ſucceſſively one after the other, unleſſe we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it only of the time that <hi>Cyrus</hi> Reigned alone after <hi>Darins</hi> death; <hi>So this</hi> Daniel <hi>proſpered in the Reign of</hi> Darius, <hi>and in the Reign of</hi> Cyrus <hi>the</hi> Perſian.</p>
                           <p>Now the Reaſons why <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeaks chiefly of <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede,</hi> as if the ruling power lay
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115824:91"/>in his hands only, ſeems to me to have been one of theſe two, or both.</p>
                           <p n="1">1 Becauſe <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede,</hi> being aged, and of the two the greater Polititian, took up his abode (<hi>Babylon</hi> being taken) in the Royal City of the Empire, managing the affairs of State, whilſt <hi>Cyrus</hi> (who was the younger and the braver Souldier) was in all likelihood yet in the field, ſubduing, and bringing into ſubjection ſuch Countries, Cities, and Towns, as did yet ſtand in the way of his abſolute Monarchy. Hence <hi>Daniel</hi> whoſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment lay in State affairs, having chiefly to do with <hi>Darius,</hi> makes mention of him as though be alone had been King.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 Becauſe <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede</hi> being much the elder, and (as ſome think) Uncle to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> things might go moſtly under his name, by reaſon whereof the name of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> (whilſt <hi>Darius</hi> lived) might be ſomewhat obſcured; therefore <hi>Daniel</hi> mentions him, who of the two was vulgarly looked upon as the leading man in ordering affairs, and doth not take ſo much notice of the other, though yet he were in power equall with him. And ſurely there might be a glorious deſign of Providence in obſcuring the name of <hi>Cyrus</hi> about the time <hi>Babylon</hi> was taken, through that of <hi>Darius;</hi> for the name of <hi>Cyrus</hi> (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> Propheſie) was grown ſo famous amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> that had they but heard the name of Commander inchief before <hi>Babylon</hi> to be <hi>Cyrus,</hi> they had not been ſo ſurpriſed with their mercy, as it is ordinary with God to deal by his people in his more glorious appearances to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:115824:91"/>them before they are aware; but whilſt they little think of a <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and hear a great noiſe of a mighty <hi>Darius, Babylon</hi> is taken, and inſtantly unlooked for, appears a <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as a firſt and leading man amongſt the Conquerors; which certainly could not but ſo ſoon as diſcovered (which in all likelihood was preſently as <hi>Babylon</hi> was taken, when now the <hi>Jews</hi> within <hi>Babylon</hi> by converſe with them, come to have a more true underſtanding of the people themſelves, the ſtate and affairs of the Conquerors) wonderouſly affect the hearts of Gods people. And whether or no, as the perceiving on the one hand the ſeventy years to be out, ſo ſome ſuch amazing Providence as this concurring on the other, might not be a whet to <hi>Daniels</hi> ſpirit the more, to be earneſt in ſtriving with God for his People, City, and Temple, I ſhall not (the Scripture being ſilent therein) take upon me to determine.</p>
                           <p>And this conſideration of <hi>Cyrus</hi> being mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted and known to Gods people laſt, doth well ſolve thoſe words, Chap. 8.3. <hi>The Ram had two Horns, and the two Horns were high, but one was higher then the other, and the higher came up laſt:</hi> Which words ſeem to have in them matter of objection againſt the thing we are ſpeaking of, and they ſeem to import, as if that <hi>Cyrus</hi> (who is the higher Horn of the two) did ſucceed <hi>Darius;</hi> and if ſo, Then how is it true that hath been ſaid, They did both Reign together? Now from what hath been ſaid, the Anſwer is eaſie, that <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeaks not of the being of the two Horns, but of their appearance; the two Horns, were both
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:115824:92"/>in being upon the head of the Ram when he puſhed down the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy; but now, as to Gods people they did not both appear at once; but <hi>Darius</hi> the lower Horn appears firſt, and <hi>Cyrus</hi> the higher Horn after him; ſo did they not to <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Viſion; firſt <hi>Daniel</hi> beholds the lower Horn, then the higher. But if this ſuffice not (becauſe there ſeems weight in the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) it may be otherwiſe anſwered; that <hi>Cyrus's</hi> coming up laſt, is not to be underſtood in reſpect of his being a Horn, but in reſpect of his being a Horn greater and higher then the other Horn: A Horn he was of power and authority equal with <hi>Darius,</hi> whilſt <hi>Darius</hi> lived; but a Horn of higher and greater authority then ever his fellow Horn had; ſo he was not till after the death of <hi>Darius,</hi> when the whole Monarchy, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was ſhared between them, fell to him alone; and in this reſpect <hi>Daniel</hi> ſees him come up laſt.</p>
                           <p>If it be asked, how long theſe two, <hi>Darius</hi> and <hi>Cyrus,</hi> did reign together.</p>
                           <p>I anſwer, Two years, at the end of which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> (who was ſixty two years old when <hi>Babylon</hi> was taken, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.31.) by death (which is moſt probable) or elſe by reſignation, devolves the whole upon <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Now that they did reign to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether two years, and no more, is clear, if we compare <hi>Dan.</hi> 1.21. with <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.1. <hi>Daniel</hi> Chap. 1.21. is ſaid to continue till the firſt year of King <hi>Cyrus, i.e.</hi> ſo long <hi>Daniel</hi> did ſurvive. In Chap. 10. <hi>Daniel</hi> ſees a Viſion in the third year of King <hi>Cyrus:</hi> How may we reconcile theſe places? did <hi>Daniel</hi> behold this Viſion two years
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:115824:92"/>after he was dead? No, we may not think ſo; but that which doth, and onely can reconcile the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is this, Chap. 1. ſpeaks of <hi>Cyrus's</hi> ſole reign, <hi>i.e.</hi> reckons from that time he began to reign alone; but Chapter 10. ſpeaks of the whole of the time that he reigned from the taking of <hi>Babylon;</hi> now that was three years, until the time <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaw this Viſion, two of which he reigned together with <hi>Darius,</hi> and the third (which is called <hi>Cyrus's</hi> firſt Chap. 1.21.) he reigned alone.

                           <p n="1">1 That the firſt year of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Dan. 1.21. is not the ſame year with that called the firſt of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 36.22. <hi>Ezra</hi> 1.1.

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:115824:93"/>which neer approach of <hi>Daniels</hi> death ſeems to me to be hinted to him twice in the end of the Viſion, Chap. 12.9. <hi>Go thy way</hi> Daniel; And again, in the very laſt words of all, <hi>But go thou thy way till the end be; for thou ſhalt reſt, and ſtand in thy lot at the end of the dayes.</hi>

                           <p>HAving in the fore-going Chapter fixed the Head of our Account, <hi>viz.</hi> with what time we are to begin the two thouſand and three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years; I ſhall now through the Lords aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance go on, and (as that which neceſſarily comes next to be handled in order to the making up our Computation) enter upon <hi>Daniels</hi> ſeventy weeks, Chap. 9.24, 25, 26, 27.</p>
                           <p>This ſeventy weeks is a leſſer Epock compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended within the greater of two thouſand and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:115824:93"/>three hundred years, conſiſting of four hundred and ninety dayes; for ſeventy weeks being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into dayes, amount to the aforeſaid num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which according to the Prophetical way of ſpeaking is ſo many years, <hi>viz.</hi> four hundred and ninety years.</p>
                           <p>Two great knots we have here to untie:</p>
                           <p n="1">1 Whether theſe ſeventy weeks relate to Old Teſtament, or New Teſtament times?</p>
                           <p n="2">2 In caſe they relate to the one, or the other, where are we to begin, and where to end them?</p>
                           <p>As touching the firſt, it is the opinion of a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy man, that this Propheſie is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the times between the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and Chriſt, but rather points out the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Reſtauration in New Teſtament times from its bondage and ſervitude under Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</p>
                           <p>But this I cannot receive.</p>
                           <p n="1">1 Becauſe <hi>this opinion leaves us wholly deſtitute of Scripture-ground, either for the making up the years of the world, or for a right ſupputation of</hi> Daniels <hi>two thouſand and three hundred years.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="2">2 Becauſe <hi>the determination of the ſeventy weeks is clearly and evidently upon the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Church, where as this ſhould be upon the Churches of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles;</hi> This is evident from the words, verſ. 24. <hi>Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people, and upon thy holy City.</hi> Thy people, and thy holy City, clearly denotes the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, and the City <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which was <hi>Daniels</hi> people, and City to be h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:115824:94"/>for theſe words coming in as an anſwer to <hi>Daniels</hi> prayer, moſt ſurely that people, and that City <hi>Daniel</hi> had been praying for, is here meant.

                           <p>Object. <hi>But the Prophets whilſt they ſpeak of the reſtauration out of</hi> Babylon <hi>temporal, do myſtically imply, and under figures deſcribe the reſtauration out of</hi> Babylon <hi>ſpiritual: Therefore though it is a truth that</hi> Daniels <hi>praier was directed for reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration out of temporal</hi> Babylon, <hi>yet notwithſtanding was he cloſely under it led by the Spirit to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration out of</hi> Babylon <hi>ſpiritual.</hi>

                              <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, the Prophets whilſt they ſpeak of the reſtauration out of <hi>Babylon</hi> temporal, do indeed myſtically imply, and under figures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the reſtauration out of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſpiritual; this in the general is a truth; but whilſt there is an application made of this general Rule to this particular Propheſie, it fails; for our Author himſelf confeſſeth that <hi>Daniel</hi> in his prayer did caſt in his thoughts the reſtauration out of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> temporal; and therefore the ſeventy weeks from his own principle, muſt have ſome relation to that, at leaſt-wiſe as a type of the other. But a typical relation it could not be; for the Text having expreſly ſaid, that <hi>ſeventie weeks ſhould ſeal up the Viſion and Propheſie,</hi> we are here by out off from looking after any Antitype, or any other fulfilling of theſe words then what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the coming out of <hi>Babylon</hi> literal, and the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:115824:94"/>death of Chriſt; therefore the relation they have to that time muſt neceſſarily be the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment of the Propheſie.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 Becauſe <hi>the Phraſes</hi> verſ. 24. <hi>to finiſh tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, to make an end of ſins, to make reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for iniquity, to bring in everlaſting Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, cannot without a manifeſt forcing be applid to any other time,</hi> then that wherein Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</p>
                           <p n="4">4 <hi>The Meſſiah the Prince,</hi> verſ. 25, 26. <hi>being called the moſt Holy,</hi> verſ. 24. (which is the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of God alone) <hi>it is not ſufferable that the ſame ſhould be applied</hi> (as doth this opinion) <hi>to the</hi> Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſian <hi>Princes,</hi> Ziſca <hi>the</hi> Bohemian, <hi>or any other creature.</hi> To interpret the anointing the moſt Holy to be ſpoken not of any perſon but of things, <hi>viz.</hi> the bringing in of Chriſts pure wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip into his Church (which is the ſenſe of the Author of this opinion) cannot be thought; ſeeing the only anointed One ſpoken of in all this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie is the Meſſiah the Prince, who being a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the anointing the moſt Holy muſt be of ſome perſon, not of things. Nay it ſeems ſtrange to me, that the word Meſſiah ſignifying the anointed One, and this whole Propheſie pointingat the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, it ſhould once be thought that the anointing the moſt Holy can be meant of any other ſave the Meſſiah, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe. And therefore learned <hi>Mede</hi> upon the words well ſaith, <hi>There is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>no interpretation of any paſſage in this Propheſie could ſeem ſo harſh, but I would be content to admit it, rather then yeeld that by Meſſiah, the Prince here named, ſhould be
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:115824:95"/>meant any other then Chriſt our Lord and Redeemer. For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I am perſwaded that the Church of</hi> Iſrael <hi>in the Goſpel, and from them the Apoſtles took it, had no other place of Scripture, whence they did, or could aſcribe the Name of Chriſt or Meſſiah un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him they looked for, but only from this of</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel. Theſe are Mr. <hi>Medes</hi> words, which carry a convincing demonſtration along with them, that the Meſſiah here ſpoken of muſt be Chriſt perſonally; but this opinion we oppoſe, neither doth, nor can ſo hold.</p>
                           <p n="5">5 <hi>The Meſſiah the Prince, or the anointed Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor</hi> (to uſe our Authors term) <hi>is not to be anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted until the ſeventieth week.</hi> verſ. 24. <hi>Seventy weeks are determined to anoint the moſt Holy.</hi> But according to the expreſſe and declared mind of the opinion we oppoſe, the Meſſiah is to be anointed after ſeven weeks of the ſeventy, <hi>i.e.</hi> nine and forty years are expired. And indeed ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable is this one Stone, that if removed, the very foundation, yea the whole fabrick of this opinion goes to decay; for neither will there be room found for the <hi>Waldenſian</hi> Princes, nor <hi>Ziſca,</hi> at the end of the ſeven weeks, or nine and forty years, in caſe the Meſſiah, the Prince, be not anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted till the ſeventieth or laſt week; and this Stone needs not a hand to be put to it; for the Text it ſelf hath removed it in telling us, that not ſeven, but ſeventy weeks are determined to anoint the moſt Holy.</p>

                           <p>Object. 1. <hi>This Propheſie ſeemeth not to relate to Old Teaſtment times, becauſe in no place of the New Teſtament do we find it uſed againſt the</hi> Jews, <hi>to prove the Meſſiah already come.</hi>

                           <p>As for all the other Arguments laid down by the Author (which are not a few) ſome to prove the Negative part of the Queſtion, ſome the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative, the bottome of them all is one of theſe two things, either,</p>
                           <p n="1">1 Falſe principles ariſing from, firſt, a miſ-interpretation of ſome phraſes and paſſages in this Propheſie: Or ſecondly, From too great a reſtraining of ſome things in <hi>Daniels</hi> other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies (which our Author would have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretative of this) to ſuch and ſuch particular Events: Or thirdly, from a leaning too much to the bare reports of Hiſtory.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 An interpretation of the phraſes here, which ſet forth Chriſt his acts and ſufferings by ſimilar phraſes in <hi>Daniel</hi> elſewhere, which point at Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt his acts, and the Churches ſufferings under him; whence the concluſion is, That this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie muſt relate to the times of Antichriſt, and the captivity of the Church of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under him. But let it be conſidered, as Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of this nature, when they are not ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ſome others more ſolid, do moſtly make up but a doubtful concluſion; ſo in the preſent caſe more eſpecially the concluſion is ſuch, yea the way of demonſtration very unſafe. For An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt being Chriſts Ape, acting over thoſe things that Chriſt himſelf did, onely with this
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:115824:96"/>difference, the acts as performed by Chriſt were holy and good, as done by Antichriſt wicked and abominable. Hence it follows, that the acts of both are ſet forth by ſimilar phraſes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. Chriſt by his death and ſufferings cauſed virtually the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ſacrifice and oblation to ceaſe (this being the time of its abrogation) v. 27. and afterwards by a totall ruining through Thunder, Lightning, and Earthquake, the very place of that ſacrifice, he actually deſtroyed it in <hi>Julians</hi> time. Antichriſt likewiſe (but in an evill ſenſe) is ſaid to take away the daily ſacrifice, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.11. Chap. 11.31. becauſe he labours to deſtroy, and by his power ſuppreſeth Chriſts true worſhip to ſet up his own. As Chriſt to ſet up Chriſtian worſhip, deſtroyed the <hi>Jewiſh;</hi> ſo he to ſet up his Antichriſtian worſhip, would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Chriſtian; therefore are the one and the other ſaid to take away the daily ſacrifice. Again, Chriſt is ſaid for the over-ſpreading of abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations to make it deſolate, <hi>i.e.</hi> make deſolate the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> worſhip, their City, Sanctuary, which thing as it was cauſed by rejecting him, ſo after his death, was performed in part by <hi>Titus,</hi> and compleatly in the time of <hi>Julian.</hi> Antichriſt likewiſe to place the abomination making deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, Chap. 11.31. <hi>i.e.</hi> to deſolate the Chriſtian worſhip, with-drawing people from it, by ſetting up his own abominable Idolatry, by which the whole world are bewitched, and led aſide. Thus other ſimilar phraſes, by conſidering the thing as done by Chriſt, and done by Antichriſt; or as relating to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church and worſhip,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:115824:97"/>and the Chriſtian, will be clear. And indeed this notion both lets a light into <hi>Daniel</hi> to reconcile ſeeming contrary places, and alſo (if duly weighed) turns up by the roots a great part of our Authors Arguments.</p>
                           <p>Adde hereto, (which takes in thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main) that there is in many things an Analogy betwixt Chriſts ſufferings who is Head, and the Chruches who are his body, and alſo betwixt the effects that follow upon either. Now one or other of theſe conſiderations will enervate the force of all the Authors Arguments, which (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many, and an anſwer to each, will take up much room, and alſo anticipate ſome things in my following Diſcourſe) I forbear to give parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Anſwers unto, leaving the drawing them forth from theſe more general conſiderations to the meditations of the underſtanding judicious Reader.</p>
                           <p>The Author of this opinion (if any ſhould blame me, or think I may injure truth whilſt I conceal his name, and therewith his Arguments) is the godly and learned Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> in his <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels</hi> Viſions and Propheſies expounded upon Chap. 9.</p>
                           <p>The Concluſion is, <hi>That the ſeventy weeks are not appliable to New Testament times, but belong to the times of the Old Teſtament.</hi>

                           <p>Having in the fore-going Section proved that the Seventy weeks relate to the times of the Old Teſtament, The next Enquiry is, Where we are to begin this Epock of Seventy weeks, <hi>i.e.</hi> four hundred and ninety years, and where to end them? In both theſe it is moſt neceſſary that our way be very clear, or otherwiſe we ſhall never carry a ſtreight line downwards; and the way being once cleared, here the difficulty will not be great to find out, where <hi>Daniels</hi> two thouſand three hundred yeers expire, as we have already found where they are to begin. And indeed there is not an Epock of years in all <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> that there is more need of being upon ſure grounds for the beginning and ending, then this of the Seventy weeks; for a falling here makes a general failing, becauſe no account, whoſe Head is in the Old Teſtament, can be brought down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the New, but muſt deſcend through theſe ſeventy weeks; if therefore we miſ-place them, we turn every account out of its proper Chanel, cutting the way either ſhorter, or by wheeling about making it longer, then indeed it is; ſo that an error here is a fundamental error in Chronologie. We ſhal therefore deſire in this to go the more warily, taking up nothing upon truſt, but bringing even the moſt common received principles to the Touchſtone of Scripture, and right Reaſon.</p>
                           <p>Now as for the firſt, <hi>viz. The beginning of the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:115824:98"/>ſeventy weeks,</hi> the Text is clear, verſ. 25. That we are to begin them <hi>from the going forth of ſome Commandement, and this Commandement ſuch too, as was not as yet gone forth when</hi> Daniel <hi>had the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but to go forth afterwards.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now we read in the Books of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> of four Commandements going forth after this time.</p>
                           <p n="1">1 A Decree, or Commandement of <hi>Cyrus, Ezra</hi> 1.1, 2, 3. which is more fully repeated, Chap. 6.3, 4, 5.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 Of <hi>Darius, Ezra</hi> 6.6 to 12.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 Of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> to <hi>Ezra, Ezra</hi> 7.11 to the end.</p>
                           <p n="4">4 Of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> to <hi>Nehemiah, Neh.</hi> 2.7, 8, 9. Upon ſome one of theſe four muſt the Head of our account be fixed.</p>
                           <p>The moſt general opinion is, that we are to fix on the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> The Edict of <hi>Cyrus</hi> in the firſt year of his reign.</p>

                           <p>Now looking upon the words thus, it doth not neceſſarily follow, becauſe <hi>Cyrus</hi> gave Decree for the one, the building of the Temple, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did for the other alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> the building <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but it proves that God would do both, and as he afterwards raiſed up <hi>Cyrus</hi> to do the one, ſo would he alſo raiſe up <hi>Cyrus,</hi> or ſome other, to do the other, when the time for doing it ſhould be come.</p>

Fourthly, He laid a happy foundation (as I am now coming to ſhew) for the perfecting the whole work of God, both concerning the Temple, and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> alſo.

                           <p n="2">2 Granting theſe words, <hi>Even ſaying to</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, <hi>thou ſhalt be built,</hi> to have relation to <hi>Cyrus;</hi> yet may the meaning of them be onely this, <hi>That God would make</hi> Cyrus <hi>the principal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, as of laying the foundation of the Temple, which was actually done by his decree, ſo alſo of building Jeruſalem;</hi> but how?</p>

                              <hi>Anſ.</hi> By removing the great impediment, namely the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy (which had ruined <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and was a profeſſed enemy to it) out of the way, and ſetting the <hi>Jews</hi> (who
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:115824:101"/>whilſt Captives could never do it) free from their Captivity, which accordingly was done by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> God making him inſtrumental to ruine <hi>Babylon,</hi> by which, as the <hi>Jews</hi> are thereupon by him ſet free to build the Temple for preſent; ſo alſo the ſupreme power came now to be in the hands of a Nation, who were more friendly to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and inclining to hear their complaints, and redreſſe their grievances for future. And in this ſenſe it may well be ſaid of <hi>Cyrus</hi> that he ſhould ſay to <hi>Jeruſalem, thou ſhalt be built, i.e.</hi> ſet open a door, which before was ſhut, for the building of it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. And to this well agrees that other Text, Chap. 45.13. <hi>I have raiſed him up in righteouſneſſe, and will direct all his wayes; he ſhall build my City, and ſhall let go my Captives, not for price, nor reward.</hi> The building Gods City, the Objectors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will never ſay was done actually by <hi>Cyrus</hi> Decree; The meaning therefore can be no other then this, That <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſhould ſet open a door for the doing of it, by deſtroying the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy that had deſolated Gods City, ſetting the captived <hi>Jews</hi> at liberty, and laying a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſuch a work afterwards, by putting forth a Decree to build the Temple, which might be, and was an inducement (as appears from <hi>Ezra</hi> 6.1, 2, 3. compared with verſes 6, 7, 8.) to his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors after him to follow their noble Leader in kindneſſe and reſpect to this Nation. And indeed it is a thing obſervable, that (for the general) of all the four Monarchies, the <hi>Perſians</hi> were ever the moſt friendly to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and moſt ready to do them right and favour, following doubtleſſe
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:115824:102"/>herein the example of their famous Founder <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to whom therefore, as being the leading man, whoſe example became a provocation to his Succeſſors, the whole work, in Scripture, and that not amiſſe, is attributed.</p>
                           <p>As for the other place in <hi>Ezra,</hi> Chap. 4.12, 13. it being onely the allegation of <hi>Judahs</hi> Adverſaries, and written to <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> for this end, to put a ſtop to the work of God, I rather conceive them to be words of meer accuſation, then of truth, by which thoſe crafty enemies endeavour to make the caſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> as foul as may be; and to beget in the King the greater diſlike of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, they ſuggeſt ſuch things to him on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe which might breed jealouſie, and cauſe a diſcountenancing of the work; and therefore they ſet before him how potent a City, bearing rule over Kings, in former times <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had been, and how that now the <hi>Jews</hi> were re-edifying of it, had ſet up the walls, and joyned the foundations. And ſome colour there was for this; for the <hi>Jews</hi> had now laid the foundation of the Temple, as appears, Chap. 3.11. and the malicious ſubtill enemies ſeeing a work on foot, and being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to miſtake, ſo they might incenſe the King, and hinder the work, call this the building of the walls of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now the Reaſons perſwading me that this was onely the enemies falſe accuſation, and that indeed there was no ſuch thing in reality, are,</p>
                           <p n="1">1 Becauſe in Chap. 3. verſ. 8. to the end, where mention is made of the <hi>Jews</hi> building, and the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:115824:102"/>progreſſe made in the work, there is not one word ſpoken of building any thing, but the Temple only.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 Becauſe the Adverſaries of <hi>Judah,</hi> when firſt the report of the <hi>Jews</hi> building was brought to them, had no report of the building <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but of the Temple only, <hi>Ezra</hi> 4.1.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 Becauſe it was in building the Temple the Adverſaries at firſt offered to joyn and build with the Jews, which <hi>Zerubbabel, Jeſhua,</hi> and the reſt would not give way unto, whereupon the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries openly oppoſe; all which is clear, <hi>Ezra</hi> 4.2, 3, 4, 5. A clear Argument, the work the Jews were about, and that the Adverſaries knew well enough, though they will not know it, was not building <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but the Temple.</p>
                           <p n="4">4 Becauſe the work that the Adverſaries upon receit of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> Letters (in anſwer to theirs) do cauſe to ceaſe, is, not the building of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but the building of the Temple, <hi>Ezra</hi> 4. verſ. 23, 24. <hi>Now when the copy of King</hi> Artaxerxes <hi>Letter was read before</hi> Rehum <hi>and</hi> Shimſhac <hi>the Scribe, and their companions, they went up in haſte to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>unto the</hi> Jews, <hi>and made them to ceaſe by force and power. Then ceaſed the work of the houſe of God, which is at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>ſo it ceaſed unto the ſecond year of the reign of</hi> Darius, <hi>King of</hi> Perſia. Now obſerve, the work the Jews were about, was the work cauſed to ceaſe, for ſo ran the Kings Commiſſion, verſ. 21, 22. the work cauſed to ceaſe, was not building <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but the Temple, the Temple-building therefore, and not the building <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was the work
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:115824:103"/>the Jews were now about. Now though we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>Ezra</hi> to be chiefly intent to ſet forth the Temple-work, yet doubtleſſe, having ſo frequent occaſion to mention the building, a hint would have been given by him, as well as the Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, of building <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> had ſuch a work been in hand.</p>
                           <p n="5">5 (Which makes it apparent that the thing was a meer fiction) becauſe, the Adverſaries in their Letters to <hi>Darius,</hi> after <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and his party were fallen anew to that very work, which before they were conſtrained to let fall, have not ſo much as one word of this, Chap. 5. verſ. 6, 7, 8, &amp;c. But now they can tell the King plainly what the <hi>Jews</hi> were about, <hi>viz.</hi> building the Temple, and not go in the dark, calling a Temple a City; and all they now propoſe to him is, only that ſearch may be made whether <hi>Cyrus</hi> made a Decree for ſuch a thing, or no. A clear Argument their former juglings were by this time diſcovered at Court; though having juggled, what by their own power, the prevalency of friends above, and that colour they had for an excuſe, it was but a miſtake, they ſaw foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons laid, and walls built, they thought it had been for a City, though upon better information they hear it was only a Temple; and they could do no other, but out of that due reſpect they bare to their Prince, his honour, and welfare, adviſe him of it; and however though a City it were not, yet the one, if ſuffered to go on, would make way for the other; By ſuch Arguments (I ſay) having by juggling at firſt put a ſtop to the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:115824:103"/>work, they make a ſhift to keep their own all the dayes of <hi>Artaxerxes;</hi> but now when <hi>Darius</hi> comes to the Crown, knowing themſelves to be tardy in their laſt Letters, and that they of the Court had found out their faultring, they will have no more of it, but rather ſeem to make a ſober Propoſition that it might be looked into whether the <hi>Jews</hi> had any Law (as they pleaded to have) to bear them out in what at preſent they were about: Whereas, had there been but the leaſt ſhadow of truth in their former accuſation, they would undoubtedly have pleaded that again, as a thing more likely by far to gain the Kings ear to them, and to alienate the King from the <hi>Jews,</hi> and altogether fruſtrate their deſign. Nay theſe imbittered enemies, whoſe language was ſo high againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> in their firſt Addreſſe <hi>(Rebels, Rebels)</hi> it is likely would never have been ſo ſober in their expreſſions, as this their ſecond ſhews them to be, had they not exceeded their bounds, and come off with diſgrace, and ſome private check for it before.</p>
                           <p n="6">6 Not to ſay much more, that which ſtrongly perſwades me yet further to be of this mind, is this, There are evidently crafty deſigns and jugglings in thoſe very Letters which carry the charge;</p>
                           <p>For firſt, obſerve, They ſpeak not one word of building the Temple, but only of building <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> the Rebellious City, yet were not they ignorant in that reſpect what the <hi>Jews</hi> were about, for they offer to joyn with them in that very work, Chap. 4.2.</p>
                           <pb n="174" facs="tcp:115824:104"/>
                           <p>Secondly, They ſpeak not a word neither, in theſe their firſt Letters, of <hi>Cyrus</hi> Decree, which yet they could not be ignorant of, for the <hi>Jews</hi> had informed them of it, Chap. 4.3. yea the very Adverſaries had hired Counſellors againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> to fruſtrate their deſign, as Chap. 4.5. What need of hiring Counſellors againſt a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe that hath no colour of Law for it?</p>
                           <p>Queſt. <hi>What may be the reaſon they are ſilent in theſe things?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſ.</hi> Becauſe the diſcovery of either of theſe might have brought their juggling to light. Had they hinted a word of buiding the Temple, they above would have enquired, What, are they building a Temple, and building a City too? which would either have driven them to confeſſe the truth, 'Tis a Temple only, but what it may grow to in time we know not; Or elſe by averring both, they had cut themſelves off their fair excuſe for time to come in caſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was but their miſtake, they thought it, by the greatneſſe of preparations, and magnificence of foundations, to be a City, but it proved but a Temple. Again, Had they but hinted the Decree of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> enquiry then would have been made for the Decree, to ſee what that allowed the <hi>Jews</hi> to do, and whether they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the bounds of it, before paſſing any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitive ſentence. And this Decree brought forth, would diſcover what the <hi>Jews</hi> had autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to do, more then which the Adverſaries knew well enough, they could not juſtly, in caſe ſtrict enquiry ſhould be made into the buſineſſe
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:115824:104"/>charge them with, and therefore they hold it policy to conceal altogether that Decree alſo. Which Decree, yet afterwards (ſee the wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of men) when their juggling is come to light, in their next addreſſe to <hi>Darius,</hi> Chap. 5. they make a great noiſe of, as willing thereby to hide their former malice, by making thoſe above to think that in their former addreſſe they were not ſo much enemies to the <hi>Jews,</hi> as loath to ſee and countenance any irregular proceedings, and that now having had ſatisfaction from the <hi>Jews</hi> that they had a Decree of <hi>Cyrus</hi> for what they did, they only think good to intimate, that the thing may be looked into, whether ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree there were, or no; not without hopes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, that through continuance of time, and mutation of affairs, the ſame might be loſt, which in caſe it were, they not only ſhould wipe off the aſperſion of malice, which now lying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them made all charges ineffectual, but alſo find a fair opportunity to draw up a new charge. But God who knows the rage of his enemies, and takes care of his people, had provided otherwiſe, and turns this their crafty rage againſt the work, even to a promoting of it, as appears from the iſſue, Chap. 6.</p>
                           <p>As for the third foot of the Objection taken from <hi>Hananies</hi> report, My Anſwer is, That the breaking down of the wall of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and burning the Gates, relates to the ruines of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>My Reaſons are,</p>
                           <p n="1">1 Becauſe no Scripture mentions any building
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:115824:105"/>of the walls of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> betwixt the time of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> (the forementioned Texts, I have proved too weak) therefore we have no ground, for faith, that ever ſuch a thing was.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 Becauſe its likely, if the walls had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built by the <hi>Jews</hi> that came up in the dayes of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and afterwards broken down again by enemies, and gates burnt, they would alſo as well have broken down the Temple and burnt that, for their malice was as great againſt the one, as the other; yea if more againſt any, it was the Temple, which, being the place of the <hi>Jews</hi> worſhip, was moſt abhorred by the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, who hated them only for Religion ſake; but this was not done, for <hi>Nehemiah</hi> coming to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> found a Temple there, <hi>Neh.</hi> 6.10.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 Becauſe ſhould I grant (which yet I cannot, there being not one tittle of Scripture for it) that City and Wall was built before, yet muſt we confeſſe withall, that this work was an obſcure thing, and no way to be compared with the after famous building of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> memorized by a whole Book, written particularly upon that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and therefore not fit in compariſon of the other, to be made head of <hi>Daniels</hi> Seventy weeks.</p>
                           <p>As for the ground of this part of the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That it could have been no news to <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> to have heard of the ancient ruines by <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſ.</hi> Neither indeed was it, nor is the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe between <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and <hi>Hanani</hi> a hearing and telling of news (as we commonly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:115824:105"/>the word) they were more ſpiritual, and better employed then ſo. <hi>Hanani</hi> was a faithful man, one that feared God above many, <hi>Neh.</hi> 7.2. This holy man coming to <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> another choice Spirit; two choice ſpirited men being now met together, having both of them great hearts for the cauſe of God, they (as 'tis comely for Saints at all times when they have the like op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, to do) preſently fall into diſcourſe about things that concern the people of God, and Gods cauſe, at that day, and all the news that paſſeth between, is indeed matter of ſo ſpiritual a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment that it is too low a term to call it news. Saith <hi>Nehemiah</hi> to <hi>Hanani,</hi> brother <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nani</hi> how fares it with our brethren at <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> O ſaith <hi>Hanani</hi> their condition is ſad, they are ſtill in the old poſture, a reproach to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and the wall of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> lyes broken down, the gates burnt with fire. This thing this good man reports, not ſo much as a matter of news (though in part of it news there was) as indeed a thing which was the preſent burden, grief and affliction of his own ſoul, and the ſouls of the remnant at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> how that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (the building of which they had long expected) continued ſtill a heap; and withall how that now (as it is Gods ordinary way to affect the hearts of his people, and heighten his enemies againſt a work, when the time thereof is come) the thing lay more heavy upon the ſpirits of all the remnant then ever, and alſo the enemies did more reproach them with their unbuilt City then ever; In this laſt lay all the news (if we may
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:115824:106"/>ſo call it) <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> upon hearing this, and through that heart-warming diſcourſe that had paſſed between them, goes home from this meeting, wondrouſly affected with the condition of Gods people, and cauſe, and betakes himſelf to his Cloſet, and there ſpreads the whole before the Lord; the iſſue whereof is favour, in the ſight of the King, and authority from him to go to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and build it.</p>
                           <p>Thus much by way of anſwer to the Texts in which the force of the Objection lyes.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, I now come to adde two or three Conſiderations from Scripture, which may be an anſwer to the whole of the Objection.</p>
                           <p n="1">1 <hi>Conſideration,</hi> Whether it be not a very ſtrange thing to ſuppoſe, that the <hi>Jews</hi> having been charged with ſuch a thing as building <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the work they were about ſtopped upon it, that yet afterwards the original Copy of <hi>Cyrus</hi> Decree being found out among the Court-Rolls, in the ſecond yer of <hi>Darius,</hi> and tranſcribed by <hi>Ezra,</hi> Chap. 6.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. not one word ſhould be mentioned of that about which had been ſo much noiſe and ſtir by the enemy; but as the Command, Chap. 1. So here the Decree ſhould run altogether upon building the Temple, and not a tittle in it of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> which, who can think otherwiſe? but that had there been but the leaſt clauſe in <hi>Cyrus</hi> Decree, empowring the <hi>Jews</hi> to the building <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> upon which the <hi>Jews</hi> had undertook it, <hi>Ezra,</hi> though it were to vindicate the actings of his Nation (and to ſhew that what they did, which was ſo ctyed
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:115824:106"/>out againſt, and they ſuffered ſo much, though unjuſtly, through forged accuſations, for, was not without Law and Authority) would not doubtleſſe, had the <hi>Jews</hi> been really guilty of the act, or the Decree allowed them any ſuch thing, in tranſcribing the Decree, have left it out.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 <hi>Conſideration,</hi> Whether the very words and manner of expreſſion uſed by the Angel, do not import an Effective command, ſuch a command as upon the going of it forth did cauſe a reſtoring and building <hi>Joruſalem?</hi> verſ. 25. <hi>Know therefore, and underſtand, that from the going forth of the Commandement to reſtore and to build</hi> Jeruſalem. Obſerve, the Command is a Command expreſly to reſtore and to build, which it is not proper to call that Command, which by vertue of it ſelf alone doth never produce any ſuch effect; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering too, that Gods Commands (as we are to look upon this, though he uſe man as an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) are every of them alwayes effective. Now let it be conſidered, whether the naked Decree of <hi>Cyrus</hi> ever had any ſuch effect? nay, is not the contrary evident, <hi>viz.</hi> That for many years after the going forth of that Decree, even untill the twentieth of <hi>Artaxerxes, Jeruſalem</hi> lay waſte as a ruined heap, <hi>Neh.</hi> 1.3. and when the time of building it came, the work had for its baſis, not that Decree, but a new one of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> by which only <hi>Nehemiah</hi> acts, and not at all by the Decree of <hi>Cyras,</hi> as is manifeſt from the whole of his Book.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 <hi>Conſideration.</hi> Whether the Angels giving <hi>Daniel</hi> ſo many ſerious hints to pry well into
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:115824:107"/>this thing, and to take heed of a too haſty conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any thing, leſt he ſhould miſtake, verſ. 25. <hi>Know therefore, and underſtand.</hi> verſ. 23. <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the matter, and conſider the Viſion.</hi> verſ. 22. <hi>I am now come forth to give thee skill and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding:</hi> I ſay, whether it ſeem not to import, that it would be a very hard thing to make a right concluſion here, and that <hi>Daniel</hi> himſelf, and others, would be exceeding apt to miſtake this commandement, upon the going forth of which the ſeventy weeks were to be begun, and therefore the Angel bids him be very cautious, and mark well every word and tittle that he was to ſpeak, that ſo he might not through affection, or otherwiſe, be drawn to make a concluſion too ſuddenly. Now let it be ſeriouſly conſidered, whether or no could there be any ſuch difficulty in the thing it ſelf, or ſuch aptneſſe in <hi>Daniel</hi> and others to miſtake about it, in caſe the Decree of <hi>Cyrus</hi> were the thing here aimed at. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, <hi>Cyrus</hi> himſelf being ſo expreſly notified by name, by the Prophet <hi>I ſaiah,</hi> many years before, (which Propheſie <hi>Daniel</hi> undoubtedly was not unacquainted with) and alſo this Decree being the firſt, and ſo the moſt famous, and alſo brought forth in ſuch a wonderful remarkable manner by Gods ſtirring up the heart of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, <hi>Ezra</hi> 1.1. and alſo coming forth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon the prayer of <hi>Daniel,</hi> for <hi>Daniel</hi> prayes in the firſt of <hi>Darius,</hi> verſ. 1. and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree comes forth in the firſt of <hi>Cyrus, Ezra</hi> 1.1. both which (I have before ſhewed) were one and the ſame year, it cannot be thought that were
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:115824:107"/>this the Decree we are to look at, that either <hi>Daniel</hi> himſelf, or any other would have been ready to miſtake here, but would ſoon ſay, our concluſion muſt be ſo, here muſt we begin, and no where elſe; And therefore (I conceive) that <hi>Daniel</hi> whoſe thoughts now run upon the ending of the ſeventy years Captivity, and had been praying for that, and the Decree of releaſe being juſt now ready to come forth, that by all theſe things meeting together, neither he, nor we, might be ſo overſet with affection, as inſtantly, without any further ſearch, to pitch down our ſtandard here, therefore doth the Angel give ſo many ſerious hints to <hi>Daniel</hi> to look upon this thing as a matter of great weight, a thing very hard to hit the right nail, in making concluſions, and a hundred to one, if he did not conclude ſalfe; and whith all ſtrongly to give a check to his thoughts, which now were all occupied about the ending of the Captivity, and therefore would be ready to catch up any thing to begin from thence, he points him to another beginning, <hi>viz.</hi> When a Command ſhould go forth for reſtoring and building <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that ſo <hi>Daniel</hi> upon the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of that famous Decree of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which was to be preſently, might not (having the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going hints, and this word, laid in before as a Caveat) be deceived, and begin the account of his ſeventy weeks from thence, but ſtill look up, and wait upon God for another time.</p>
                           <p>Yea undoubtedly the Angel being ſo carefull in this to make us know and underſtand, would, had the Decree of building the Temple been
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:115824:108"/>that here mentioned, have given it that name, and not another, of reſtoring and building <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> (betwixt which two were many years) hereby opening a wide door of miſtake to after-times who ſhould live to ſee this Decree, as well as the other, and yet muſt account from the other.</p>
                           <p n="4">4 <hi>Conſideration,</hi> Which I take from the mouth of the Prophet <hi>Zechary,</hi> who began to Prophefie in the ſecond year of that <hi>Darius</hi> who advanced the work of the Temple, as <hi>Zech.</hi> 1.1.7. <hi>Ezra.</hi> 4.24. compared with Chap. 5.1. which was many years after the firſt of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Now obſerve, in his time Gods meaſuring Line for the building of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had not as yet paſſed upon it, as is clear from Chap. 1.16. and Chap. 2.1, 2.3, 4. In Chap. 1. verſ. 16. <hi>Zechary</hi> hath this by way of promiſe, <hi>Auline ſhall be ſtretched forth upon</hi> Jeruſalem. In Chap. 2. <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi> Viſionally ſees the thing done, having withall a promiſe addud to it, that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> again ſhould be inhabited, verſ. 1. <hi>I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a meaſuring line in his hand.</hi> verſ. 2. <hi>Then ſaid I, Whither goeſt thou? and he ſaid unto me, To meaſure</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>to ſee what is the breadth thereof, and what the length thereof.</hi> verſ. 3. <hi>And behold the Angel that talked with me went forth, and another Angel went out to meet him.</hi> verſ. 4. <hi>And ſaid unto him, Run, ſpeak to the young man, ſaying,</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem <hi>ſhall be inhabited: us Towns without walls, for the multitude of men, and cattle therein.</hi> Now mind it, <hi>Zechary</hi>'s ſeeing the thing Viſionally,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:115824:108"/>with a promiſe it ſhould be done is a clear Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the real paſſing the meaſuring line upon <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for the building thereof, was a thing not yet done, but to be ſome time after. Now conſider, can we imagine that God ſhould cauſe a Decree to come forth by <hi>Cyrus</hi> for the building of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> before yet himſelf had paſſed his meaſuring line upon it? or that the <hi>Jews,</hi> having ſuch choice guides with them as <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Jeſhua,</hi> ſhould attempt to lay the foundations, and build up the walls of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that in a way of fore-ſtalling Providence, laying their meaſuring lines before yet God had laid his? ſurely it cannot be.</p>
                           <p>My Concluſion therefore from the whole is, <hi>That that famous Decree of</hi> Cyrus, <hi>ſo generally harped upon, cannot be the Commandement here ſpoken of, from the going forth of which we are to begin our Epock of four hundred and ninety years.</hi>
                           </p>

                           <p>Beſides the Decree of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which Decree was the firſt, we read in <hi>Ezra</hi> of a <hi>ſecond Decree</hi> that concerned the Jews, and their welfare, which forth came from <hi>Darius,</hi> whereof mention is made Chap. 6. verſ. 6, 7, 8, &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>But this <hi>cannot be the Commandement here ſpoken of,</hi> which by the Angel is made Head of our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, for the ſame reaſon diſproving the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>becauſe this Decree concerned the Temple only,</hi> not <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whereof we have not one
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:115824:109"/>tittle in the whole Decree; and alſo it concerned not ſo much the building of the Temple, as the removal of that which was an impediment in the way to the going on of the work, which work had ſtill for its baſis the old Decree of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> only the impediment is removed by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a new; but now the Decree which is to be Head of our account is a Decree expreſly to build, therefore cannot be this Decree.</p>
                           <p>Yet the learned <hi>Mede</hi> in his Treatiſe upon <hi>Daniels</hi> Weeks (whom I am neceſſitated here to mention by name, becauſe I can neither ſtate his opinion, nor anſwer it, without referring often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the Author) is of the mind our fixation muſt be here.</p>
                           <p>That by which he would evade the reaſon of the words, <hi>viz. That we are to begin from the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of</hi> Jeruſalem, is, He would diſtinguiſh the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Holy City, from the beginning of <hi>Jeruſalem; For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Holy City is ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of the Temple the principal part, and therefore the time of the reſtitution thereof is to be reckoned from the time that the Temple was builded; but by</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem <hi>is underſtood the external buildings and walls of the City, which were not reſtored till ſome time after the Temple &amp; Sanctuary was finiſhed, Daniels</hi> Weeks <hi>p.</hi> 3. (as the Treatiſe is printed by it ſelf, as it is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his whole Works, the Page is different.</p>
                           <p>To ſpeak more plainly to the Readers capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, Mr. <hi>Medes</hi> opinion is this; <hi>That the ſeventy weeks are one Epock, and the ſixty two weeks ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, being a leſſer period of time comprehended within the Seventy, whoſe beginning</hi> (as he ſaith
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:115824:109"/>page 10.) <hi>was to be after the Seventy were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and the end before they ſhould be ended.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And as he makes the Seventy weeks to begin from the perfecting the work of the Temple in the ſixth year of <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> as is his opinion, and to end with the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> ſo doth he the ſixty two weeks to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin from the ſeventh year of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> when <hi>Ezra</hi> had Commiſſion to cauſe to return, and carry with him as many of the Jews as he would to <hi>Jeruſalem, Ezra</hi> 7.7.13. and alſo from the twentieth year of the ſame <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> when <hi>Nehemiah</hi> obtained leave to build <hi>Jeruſalem, Nehem.</hi> 2. and to end with the death of Chriſt. Onely he makes a difference betwixt <hi>Solar</hi> years, and <hi>Lunar,</hi> reckoning ſixty two <hi>Solar</hi> years from the time of <hi>Ezraes</hi> going up, to the Death of Chriſt, but ſixty two <hi>Lunar</hi> from <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s: ſixty two weeks, or four hundred thirty four <hi>Lunar</hi> years, being (as he ſaith) ſo many leſſe, then ſo many <hi>Solar,</hi> as there are years betwixt the ſeventh and twentieth of <hi>Artaxerxes, p.</hi> 21. and to this latter beginning he makes the Command to build <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to refer, and not to the former.</p>
                           <p>This is the full of Mr. <hi>Medes</hi> opinion, which with what clearneſſe I am able, I have ſet forth; and now muſt ſay, though I highly honour the Author, and his indgement in many things, yet in this particular cannot I cloſe with him.</p>
                           <p>My Reaſons are,</p>

                           <p n="3">3 <hi>Becauſe</hi> Mr. Medes <hi>Diſtinction (which is the foundation of his whole Opinion) is unſound; yea, if the ground of it be throughly weighed, there is enough in the thing it ſelf, to overthrow the whole building.</hi> For whereas Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> would put a difference betwixt the Holy City and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> making the beginning of the Holy City to be from the time the Temple was finiſhed, but the beginning of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> not to be till afterwards; Let it (in anſwer thereunto) be conſidered, That although the Temple, when ſpoken of alone, is called the Holy place, yet is it never called the Holy City, but with a reference ſtill to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> As the City <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is no otherwiſe ſaid to be Holy, but as it hath reference to the Temple, the onely place of Gods worſhip being there fixed; ſo cannot the Temple, the place of Gods Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, be called a Holy City, any otherwiſe then as it hath reference to the City <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> joyned to it; Both compacted together make up the Holy City, either claiming a ſhare in the name. That it is Holy, is from the Temple; that a City, from <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> that a Holy City, from both. And therefore it is obſervable, as <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is never in any other Scripture called (unleſſe in a Prophetical way of what ſhould be for future) the Holy City, but ſtill with reference to the Temple fixed in it, ſo do we not find in all <hi>Ezra</hi> (which Book relates to the time we are
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:115824:111"/>upon) ſo much as once mention made of the Holy City, till afterwards in the dayes of <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> Chap. 11.1.18. which was after <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was built, and City, and Temple, now again ſtanding together. Yea whereas the Angel ſaith to <hi>Daniel, Seventy weeks are determined upon thy Holy City,</hi> what City doth he mean, but that City <hi>Daniel</hi> had been praying for, which was not the Temple onely, but <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with its Temple both together? Now ſeeing that Seventy weeks are determined upon the Holy City, and the Holy City cannot be ſo called from the Temple onely, but Temple and City together, it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follows that there can be no other beginning of the Seventy weeks, but what is fetched from the time when Temple and City were again joyned together, ſo making up the Holy City, <hi>Daniels</hi> Holy City; nor can the duration of the Seventy weeks be any longer then <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſtands with its Temple in it, owned by God for the place of his worſhip; which as it cuts off both Mr. <hi>Medes</hi> beginning and ending of his Seventy weeks, who begins before the City was built, and ends many years after God had rejected the Temple as the place of his worſhip; So is it a ſtrong Argument againſt any beginning what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever that ſhall begin the Seventy weeks any time before City and Temple ſtood together, or ending, that ſhall end them any time after God had rejected the Temple as the place of his worſhip.</p>
                           <p n="4">4 <hi>Becauſe</hi> Mr. Medes <hi>beginning of the Seventy weeks (take the ſame nakedly in it ſelf, and out
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:115824:111"/>foregoing Arguments ſet aſide) appears improbable;</hi> For he begins with the ſixth of <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> the King under whom (as he ſuppoſeth) the Temple-work was advanced in his ſecond year, and finiſhed in his ſixth. But how improbable is this that <hi>Darius Nothus</hi> ſhould be the <hi>Darius</hi> here meant, even from Mr. <hi>Medes</hi> own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, who upon the matter grants us one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirteen years betwixt the firſt of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and the ſixth of <hi>Darius Nothus;</hi> for, ſaith he, p. 9. the ſixth year of <hi>Darius Nothus</hi> is concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent with the three hundred and thirtieth <hi>Nabonaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarean</hi> year; but now the firſt year of <hi>Cyrus</hi> was <hi>An.

Now though the Temple-work was after <hi>Cyrus</hi> firſt at a ſtand for divers years, yet not for one hundred and thirteen; for conſider, <hi>Zerub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel,</hi> who leading <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Babylon</hi> in the firſt of <hi>Cyrus</hi> did lay the foundation ſtone, hath a promiſe made to him that he ſhould lay the Top-ſtone, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4.7, 8, 9.

                           <p n="5">5 <hi>Becauſe Mr.</hi> Medes <hi>ending of the Seventy weeks not till the time of</hi> Jeruſalems <hi>deſtruction, is expreſly againſt the ſeveral Characters of the Text,</hi> verſ. 24.

                           <p n="6">6 And laſtly, <hi>Becauſe Mr.</hi> Mede, <hi>to confirm and make good this opinion, is conſtrained to lay down (and that in his very foundation) two ſtrange Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for either of which the Text it ſelf affords no ſolid bottome,</hi> nor any other Scripture ſufficient warrant; and they are,</p>
                           <p n="1">1 Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> interprets the Angels words, verſ. 25. <hi>Know therefore, and underſtand, that from the going forth of the Command to reſtore and to build Jeruſalem,</hi> to have relation not to the beginning of the Seventy weeks, but of the <hi>ſixty two weeks,</hi> whereas it is moſt evident that the period or time the Angel had ſpoken of in the foregoing
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:115824:112"/>verſe (with a determination there of the end) the beginning of which <hi>Daniel</hi> now ſeeks after, and the Angel declares to him, was the Seventy weeks, not the Sixty two weeks, which is not ſpoken of till afterwards; and therefore its more agreeable to the ſcope of the words, to make the going forth of the Commandement to reſtore and to build <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the beginning of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty weeks, then of the Sixty two weeks; to which if they are to be referred, the Angel ſhould point out a period for beginning, before he had told <hi>Daniel</hi> any thing of the time. Nay, if this Command to build <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> be not the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Seventy weeks, then is there not in all the words any expreſſe Head of account for them, for there is no other Head, but this onely, in the words, unleſſe we ſay the Seventy are to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun from the time of the Viſion, which is as wide from, and as inconſiſtent with Mr. <hi>Medes</hi> whole Diſcourſe, as any thing can be ſaid. Yea farther obſerve, the Angel layes down this Head of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with great care, that <hi>Daniel</hi> might not miſtake, <hi>Know therefore, and underſtand.</hi> Now it is not a thing likely that the Angel ſhould take ſo much care to make us underſtand aright the beginning of the leſſer Period (as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> calls it) of the ſixty two weeks, and take no care to point us a beginning for the greater Period of the Seventy weeks, which (as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> alſo ſaith) compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the other; and therefore by conſequence, if we know not where to begin and end that, the bare knowledge of the other will adde but little to us.</p>
                           <pb n="192" facs="tcp:115824:113"/>
                           <p n="2">2 Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> is driven to aſſert the ſeven weeks and the ſixty two weeks, verſ. 25. to be one and the ſame, he reading the words thus, <hi>There ſhall be ſevens of weeks, and threeſcore and two weeks;</hi> that is (ſaith he) many ſevens of weeks, ſo many as amount to ſixty two weeks of years, there being in ſixty two week, nine times ſeven wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one, which little want (ſaith he) makes no matter, there being eight whole Sevens beſides in the number, <hi>p.</hi> 12. So he makes the ſixty two weeks explicatory of the ſeven weeks, and the fame number to be in both, only ſet forth under di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe expreſſions. But this as it ſeems to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curious; ſo Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> himſelf ſaw ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricacies in aſſerting it, that he confeſſeth <hi>p.</hi> 14. that could the ſeven weeks be well beſtowed the chiefeſt difficulty were taken off this Propheſie. Nay let me ſay, this cannot be, but only with that ſuppoſition that the ſeventy weeks are one period, and the ſixty two another, which hath been diſproved already. To all the reſt I might adde, that Mr. <hi>Medes</hi> diſtinction betwixt <hi>Solar</hi> and <hi>Lunar</hi> years, which muſt come in to help, or elſe all ſaid will not do, is over-curious, yea groundleſſe, having no firm footing, to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſuch a way of computing either in the Text, or any other Scripture.</p>
                           <p>The Concluſion is, <hi>That Mr.</hi> Medes <hi>opinion, which begins the ſeventy weeks with the ſixth year of</hi> Darius Nothus, <hi>is not that which we are to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and cleave to as truth, and the mind of God in this place.</hi>

                           <p>A <hi>third Decree,</hi> or Commandement, we have in <hi>Ezra</hi> Chap. 7. <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth year of his Reign; But <hi>this cannot be the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement we are to look at;</hi> For neither did it concern the building of the Temple, which work, as to the building, was finiſhed before in the ſixth year of <hi>Darius, Ezra.</hi> 6.15. nor the building <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whereof not one word is ſpoken. But it was only a Licence given to <hi>Ezra,</hi> and ſome <hi>Jews</hi> with him, to go up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to offer ſacrifice, and if need were to repair the Temple, in caſe of any decay there might be ſince the time the building-work was finiſhed, or otherwiſe to adde ſomething to the work by way of beauty or ornament, which ſeems to be inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, <hi>Ezra</hi> 7.27. with a Command moreover to the Treaſurers beyond the River, to furniſh <hi>Ezra</hi> with monies and other neceſſaries for the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hereof; which looks in nothing like the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement we are now enquiring after. I might adde, that ſeveral of the Reaſons we have before laid down to diſprove the former opinions, fall with equal force upon this, as might be ſhewed; but I forbear, becauſe the reaſon of the Text lies ſo directly againſt this, that there needs no more to be rehearſed.</p>
                           <p>There is but one <hi>Decree more</hi> that any can imagine, and that is of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> in the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year of his Reign, and given forth to <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah;</hi> of which we may read <hi>Nehem.</hi> 2.</p>

                           <p>Now this (as I conceive) <hi>is the Commandement, from the going forth of which, we are to begin this Epock of four hundred and ninety years.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>My reaſons are,</p>
                           <p n="1">1 <hi>Becauſe this Commandement came forth in as ſolemn a manner as any of the other.</hi> The firſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of <hi>Cyrus</hi> came forth preſently upon <hi>Daniels</hi> praying and mourning, ſo doth this upon <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miahs,</hi> Chap. 1.4, 5. The one hath as ſolemn a riſe, as the other.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 Reaſon, <hi>Becauſe the work that this Decree concerned, was a work in its ſelf as famous every whit as the work of the Temple,</hi> as appears, Firſt, By the large deſcription we have left us of the thing, by the Lord himſelf; a whole Book (viz. <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miahs</hi>) being written in a manner upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, in which we have the work, in the parts and circumſtances of it, more exactly laid down then is the work of the Temple in the foregoing Book of <hi>Ezra.</hi> Secondly, The great oppoſition it met with by enemies, declaring it to be a work where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Gods cauſe and glory was greatly concerned. Thirdly, The calling of this work, Gods work, <hi>Neh.</hi> 3.5. and a work in which God did ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently appear in carrying it on, and defending the workmen, that the very enemies themſelves confeſſe the work to be wrought of God, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 6.16. which conſiderations are ſufficient to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ſome exceptions I have met with, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing this work of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> as a private buſineſſe, and a thing too mean to be made the Head of this famous Epock. And indeed I have ſometimes thought, that one reaſon why ſo
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:115824:114"/>large a ſtory is left us of this work, might be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe without a knowledge hereof, we could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have found the certain time with which we are to begin <hi>Daniels</hi> ſeventy weeks, which is a thing of ſo great concernment, as the Head of no one number in Scripture like it.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 <hi>Becauſe this Decree agrees much better to the Angels words, then either the Decree of</hi> Cyrus, <hi>or any of the other two:</hi> For obſerve, the Commandement ſpoken of by the Angel, is a Commandement to reſtore and build <hi>Jeruſalem, Know therefore and underſtand, that from the going forth of the Decree to reſtore, and to build</hi> Jeruſalem. Yea ſuch a building as ſhould rear up again the ſtreet and walls of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as the following words ſhew. Now neither of the former Decrees did this, for when <hi>Nehemiah</hi> firſt thought upon the work, the walls of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were broken down, the Gates burnt with fire, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1.3, 4. after the work of building the walls was finiſhed, yet the houſes were not builded, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 7.1, 4.—the City was large and great, but the people were few therein, and the houſes were not builded. The meaning ſurely is, That notwithſtanding there might be here and there particular houſes in which the people did reſide, yet <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as a City with houſes compacted making a ſtreet, was not yet built (which is the thing the Angel mentions to <hi>Daniel,</hi> to the end we might not look upon the building of ſome particular houſes, to be, in the intent of the Holy Ghoſt, the building of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> but rather reckon it from the time when walls and ſtreet began to be built.) But now
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:115824:115"/>in <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> time both theſe were done, he built the walls of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that in ſo ſhort a time as was even a miracle, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 6.15. and he built the houſes alſo, and <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> Decree did authorize him to do both theſe, Chap. 2.5, 8. And this was a larger power then ever was given before by any of the precedent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees.</p>
                           <p n="4">4 <hi>Becauſe this beginning ſtands reconciled</hi> (as our computation of the two thouſand three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred dayes by virtue of it will make appear) <hi>with thoſe Scripture-principles, which require a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in their ends betwixt the two thouſand three hundred dayes, and the one thouſand three hundred thirty five, and alſo the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes, and the one thouſand two hundred and ninety;</hi> which all the other beginnings are at variance, and open war with.</p>
                           <p>What ſhall I ſay more? to make the whole of this long Diſcourſe clear and undoubted, in one word, Conſider, That the <hi>Jews</hi> had a <hi>two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold</hi> Reſtoration, and a <hi>double</hi> building-work; Firſt, <hi>A ſpiritual Reſtoration,</hi> or a Reſtoration as they were a Church, and a building-work at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that, <hi>viz. Of the Temple;</hi> Secondly, <hi>A Civil Reſtoration,</hi> or a Reſtoration as they were a Commonwealth, and a building-work attending that, viz. <hi>Of the City Jeruſalem.</hi> Both theſe <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> in his prayer had been pleading for, <hi>viz. The Reſtoration of City and Sanctuary.</hi> Accordingly, in the anſwer given to him by the Angel, we have a double Command; Firſt, A Command which concerned the firſt only, viz. <hi>The Temple-work,</hi>
                              <pb n="197" facs="tcp:115824:115"/>which was the Command of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and is that Commandement which is ſaid to come forth at the beginning of <hi>Daniels</hi> ſupplication, verſ. 23. <hi>i.e.</hi> whilſt <hi>Daniel</hi> is praying <hi>Cyrus</hi> enacts this Law, and ſo part of <hi>Daniels</hi> prayer had a preſent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; Secondly, A Command reſpecting the ſecond, viz. <hi>The work of the City and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</hi> which is the Commandement to reſtore, and to build <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> verſ. 25.—The coming forth of this was to be for future; and (I take it) this latter Commandement hath therefore this particular notation, <hi>Of building Jeruſalem,</hi> that <hi>Daniel,</hi> nor we, might not miſtake, and account it the ſame with the other, verſ. 23. Now obſerve, the Angel fixing the Head of the ſeventy weeks upon the Command for <hi>building Jeruſalem,</hi> it is a clear Argument that <hi>we are to begin the ſeventy weeks with the</hi> Jews <hi>Civil Reſtoration, not their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Concluſion therefore is, <hi>That the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement from the going forth, of which we are to begin our four hundred and ninety years, is the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of</hi> Artaxerxes <hi>to</hi> Nehemiah, <hi>in the twentieth year of his Reign.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thus much as touching our beginning of this famous Epock of <hi>Daniels</hi> ſeventy weeks, or four hunddred and ninety years.</p>

                           <p>Worthy Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> (with whom we have been contending already about the beginning) is of opinion that we are to end the ſeventy weeks with the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> But having before proved his Beginning to be falſe, his End muſt neceſſarily be ſo too. And indeed, the moſt of our Reaſons, but the three firſt eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, laid down to diſprove his beginning, do lye as ſtrongly againſt this end, take the ſame, as it is aſſerted by him, or any other.</p>
                           <p>But that which here I ſhall farther adde, is, <hi>That this ending of the ſeventy weeks is altogether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Text, which points us to another ending point,</hi> viz. <hi>the death of the Meſsiah;</hi> as the evident Characters in the Text declare.</p>
                           <p n="1">1 CHARACTER. <hi>The ſeventy weeks are determined upon</hi> Daniels <hi>Holy City. Seventy weeks are determined upon thy Holy City;</hi> therefore to be extended no farther then the time that <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem remained the Holy City.</hi> But now <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (as I have obſerved before) remained the Holy City no longer then God did <hi>own the Temple</hi> in it as the only place of his worſhip; and this was <hi>onely till the Death of Chriſt,</hi> the Meſſiah; after which the veil of the Temple is rent in twain, the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sacrifice and Oblation ceaſeth, <hi>Neither in this Mountain, nor in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſhall men now any longer</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> excluding other places, as it was all the time of the Law) <hi>worſhip the Father.</hi>

                           <p>Unto the fore-going Opinion, which ends the ſeventy weeks with the Paſſion of Chriſt, doth excellently accord the ſeven weeks, and the ſixty two weeks in the following verſe (which Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> confeſſeth to be the greateſt knot in this Propheſie) the difficulty hereby being wholly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, and thereby our opinion as touching the ending of the ſeventy weeks confirmed.</p>
                           <p>But ere this can be made appear, it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the knot concerning the ſeven weeks be untied.</p>
                           <p>Four opinions (beſides that of Mr. <hi>Medes,</hi> whereof mention was made before) there are of theſe ſeven weeks, neither of which can I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
                           <p n="1">1 The firſt is, that which would have the <hi>ſeven weeks to be weeks of dayes, and the ſixty two weeks, weeks of yeers;</hi> the meaning of the opinion is,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:115824:117"/>That the dayes of the ſeven weeks ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of Natural dayes, a day conſiſting of four and twenty hours, but in the ſixty two, of Prophetical dayes, a day for a year, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly it would have theſe ſeven weeks to bee meant of the two and fifty dayes, wherein the Wall of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was finiſhed, <hi>Neh.</hi> 6.15. which (ſaith the Author) though they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſomewhat more then ſeven weeks, yet ſhort of ſeven and a half, and ſo not to be regarded in account of weeks.</p>
                           <p>But this cannot be,</p>
                           <p n="1">1 Becauſe <hi>It is againſt all Scripture accounts,</hi> yea reaſon it ſelf, to conceive that in one and the ſame Epock of ſeventy weeks, we ſhould (without any compelling reaſon from the Text ſo to do) interpret ſome of the weeks of dayes Natural, ſome of dayes Prophetical.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 Becauſe <hi>The Angel aſſigns no proper work to the ſeven weeks, as diſtinct from the ſixty two,</hi> no reaſon therefore wee ſhould. Nay, in caſe we ſo do, its more conſonant to the Angels words to attribute the building of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> with its Wall, to the ſixty two weeks, then to the ſeven weeks; For ſaith the Angel, <hi>Sixty two weeks the ſtreet ſhall be built again, and the wall, even in trouble ſome times.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="2">2 A ſecond opinion (and the moſt common) is, That which makes the <hi>ſeven weeks the Period of time the ſecond Temple was building,</hi> and the ſixty two weeks the time thence to Chriſt, in which time <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was again built, and inhabited.</p>
                           <pb n="202" facs="tcp:115824:118"/>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſ.</hi> This cannot I ſubſcribe,</p>
                           <p n="1">1 Becauſe <hi>it ſuppoſeth ſeven weeks of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty to be expired before Jeruſalem began to be built,</hi> whereas I have already proved at large the ſeventy weeks are to take beginning thence. The very foundation therefore of this opinion is a miſtake as to the beginning of the ſeventy weeks.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 Becauſe <hi>it is a thing that cannot be proved from the teſtimony of any clear undeniable Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the ſecond Temple was in building ſeven weeks,</hi> i.e. <hi>nine and forty years.</hi> As for that, <hi>John</hi> 2.20. Forty and ſix years was this Temple in building, which place ſome make interpretative of <hi>Daniels</hi> ſeven weeks, ſuppoſing the Temple to be perfected in the ſeventh week, towards the end, or about the middle of it, which will agree well to ſix and forty yeers; Not to ſay, In caſe the thing were ſo, that the words can have no relation to <hi>Daniels</hi> ſeventy weeks, the ſeventy weeks not beginning (as I have proved) till after the Temple-work was finiſhed;</p>
                           <p>My Anſwer is, That it is a thing doubted among good men, whether theſe words have any relation at all to <hi>Zerubbabels</hi> Temple, or not; for ſome conceive they relate to <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, which computing from the time <hi>David</hi> made preparation for the building there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, till the ſame by <hi>Solomon</hi> was finiſhed, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to about ſix and forty years; But others, with more reaſon, and likelihood of truth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to the Temple <hi>Herod</hi> built, who (to
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:115824:118"/>ingratiate himſelf with the Jews) pulled down the former Temple <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> had built, build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, inſtead thereof, another more large, rich and ſumptuous Temple (as is teſtified by <hi>Joſephus, Antiq. lib.</hi> 15. <hi>Cap.</hi> 14.) which Temple was the Temple then ſtanding; And this work (as Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> in his Harmony of the four Evangeliſts upon the Text, proveth) had been in hand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly ſix and forty years before the time Chriſt and the Jews had this Diſcourſe, the probability of which opinion (conſidering the Jews ſpake of a Temple that was, not that had been) weighs down, in my opinion, all others. But if yet any do adhere to the opinion of <hi>Zerubbabels</hi> Temple, and accordingly ſet this Scripture againſt my Argument, let them (which they muſt) produce ſome Scripture ſpeaking the thing that <hi>Zerub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babels</hi> Temple is here meant; till that is done, we are in uncertainties, and an uncertain ground is too weak to prove a thing, or diſprove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                           <p>And indeed learned men generally ſeem not in the preſent caſe to lay much weight up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Text; for thoſe, on the one hand, who conceive the ſecond Temple was finiſhed in the ſixth year of <hi>Darius Hyſtaſpes,</hi> reckon not half ſix and forty years, betwixt <hi>Cyrus</hi> his firſt, and <hi>Hyſtaſpes</hi> ſixth year: And thoſe, on the other, who judge the work was not finiſhed untill the ſixth of <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> reckon between the firſt of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and the ſixth of <hi>Nothus,</hi> above twice ſix and forty years: Yet is not this Text
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:115824:119"/>judged by either to have that weight in it, as to make them alter their opinions.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Alſted (in Chronologia Monarchiae Perſarum)</hi> would find out a way to uphold this opinion, <hi>viz. That</hi> Zerubbabels <hi>Temple was ſix and forty years in building, and yet will not have the compleat finiſhing of the work to be till the ſixth year of</hi> Darius No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus, <hi>which</hi> (according to his account) <hi>reckoning from the ſecond year of</hi> Cyrus, <hi>when the foundation was laid, was one hundred and eleven years.</hi> But to do this he reckons only the time they were build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, leaving out the time the work was at a ſtay. But as it is a moſt unlikely thing, that the Jews, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo conſiderable a company, as was that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that came up from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and attending wholly to this work, ſhould ſpend ſix and forty years inthe meer building-work, who afterwards in <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> time did in two and fifty dayes build the whole walls of <hi>Jeruſalem, Neh.</hi> 6.15. So is it as unlikely (which yet <hi>Alſted</hi> to make good his opinion ſuppoſeth) that thoſe enemies of <hi>Judah</hi> ſhould ſit ſtill, and ſuffer the work quietly to go on, without intermedling in the leaſt to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, ſix and thirty years together, <hi>viz.</hi> all the time of <hi>Darius Hyſtaſpes,</hi> who at other times were ready and active, whenſoever they ſaw the work on foot, to hinder it.</p>
                           <p>To ſay no more, the whole of the opinion is made up of meer ſuppoſitions; As firſt, That the <hi>Darius, Ezra</hi> 4.5. is <hi>Hyſtaſpes.</hi> Secondly, That the Jews did build all the time of his Reign. Thirdly, That <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> Ezra 4.6. and <hi>Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes,</hi>
                              <pb n="205" facs="tcp:115824:119"/>verſ. 7. were two divers perſons. Fourthly That <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> was <hi>Xerxes</hi> the Great. Fifthly, That in the beginning of his Reign the Temple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work was ſtopped, which yet went on again in the ſix laſt years of his Reign. Sixthly, That the <hi>Artaxerxes, Ezra</hi> 4.7. was <hi>Longimanus,</hi> who throughout his Reign, forty years together, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the work. Seventhly, That <hi>Darius,</hi> who in his ſecond year ſet the work on foot, bringing it to perfection in his ſixth, was <hi>Darius Nothus;</hi> never an one of all which can be proved by any clear Scripture, yet not one of them but is and muſt be ſuppoſed, to make good this opinion.</p>
                           <p>Let the Reader therefore judge what proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility is in it; And alſo by the way take notice, to learn hence never to take up things upon truſt; what a do is made, by not a ſew, to prove a thing that is not, or at leaſt that cannot be made appear to be? to prove <hi>Zerubbabels</hi> Temple was ſix and forty years in building, becauſe it is ſaid, Six and forty years was this Temple in building; whereas indeed, if we follow the opinion to the heels, it cannot be proved that <hi>Zerubbabels</hi> Temple is there ſpoken of. Could any demonſtrative Text be brought to prove that, it would then be worth while to look after the ſix and forty years, but to ſpend time about it, while the main Queſtion is begged, is but loſt labour.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 A third opinion there is of theſe ſeven weeks, which makes them to <hi>be the term of time</hi> Jeruſalems <hi>Wall and City was building,</hi> which was nine and forty years (ſaith the Author of it)
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:115824:120"/>reckoning from the firſt of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to the two and thirtieth of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> when <hi>Nehemiah</hi> having finiſhed the whole work returneth again to the King, <hi>Neh.</hi> 13.6.</p>
                           <p>But this cannot be,</p>
                           <p n="1">1 Becauſe what I have already ſaid in my ſecond Reaſon, in anſwer to the firſt opinion, lies with the ſame weight againſt this.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 Becauſe the building of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was no part of <hi>Cyrus</hi> Decree (as formerly I have proved) which yet this opinion ſuppoſeth; yea the whole ſtreſſe of it lyes upon the neck of this ſuppoſition.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 Becauſe in beginning the ſeven ſo high, it doth alſo begin the ſeventy weeks as high as <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which is an error.</p>
                           <p n="4">4 Becauſe the Author fails greatly in point of Chronologie, whilſt he accounts but nine and forty years betwixt <hi>Cyrus</hi> firſt, and <hi>Nehemiah's Artaxerxes</hi> two and thirtieth year, which upon a due examination (when we ſhall come to it) will appear to be many more.</p>
                           <p n="4">4 There is yet another opinion alſo of theſe ſeven weeks (not much differing from that I na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med laſt) <hi>viz. That theſe ſeven weeks are the time</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>with the reſt of the Cities of</hi> Judah <hi>were building and repairing.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But this cannot ſtand, becauſe of our ſecond Reaſon, laid down in anſwer to the firſt opinion, which batters this alſo; and alſo becauſe, the very foundation of it is neither Scripture, nor Story, but pure and meer conjecture, as Maſter <hi>Mede</hi> proveth, who oppoſeth himſelf to this
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:115824:120"/>opinion. <hi>Daniels Weeks,</hi> page 15.</p>
                           <p>What hath been hitherto ſaid by way of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to each, is ſufficient to ſhew the inconſiſtency of all thoſe opinions, with the words, which make the ſeven weeks one time, the ſixty two another, aſſigning ſeveral works to the ſeveral times.</p>
                           <p>Seeing therefore none of theſe can ſtand, nor the fore-mentioned conjecture of Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> I ſhall now lay down what I conceive of the Text, reading the word thus, with an alteration of the ſtops onely, <hi>Know therefore, and underſtand, that from the going forth of the Commandement to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore, and to build</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>unto the Meſſiah the Prince, ſhall be ſeven weeks, and ſixty two weeks, the ſtreet ſhall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.</hi> The meaning is, That from the time the command to build <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould go forth, untill the appearance of the Meſſiah, ſhould be ſixty nine weeks; all which time, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the great troubles and overturnings that within it ſhould be in the world, through the tranſlation of the Monarchy from the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> to the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and from them to the <hi>Romans</hi> (all which fell out within this time) and the diſtractions of particular Kingdomes, and the great oppoſition that ſhould be made againſt the Jews; yet ſuch ſhould Gods care of, and his providence over his people be, in this ſo mighty a hurly burly, and commotion of Nations, and particular oppoſitions made againſt them, as that in deſpight of all, <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
                              <pb n="208" facs="tcp:115824:121"/>throughout this troublous time ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue building and built. And ſo obſerve, the words, as they ſet forth the length of the time from the day <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould begin to be built, untill the Meſſiahs appearance, ſo do they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude within them a ſweet and gracious promiſe of the care God would have of his people, through and amiuſt all theſe toſſings, untill the Meſſiah ſhould appear, they ſhould ſtill be preſerved one way or other, who ever went to wrack; and this notably anſwers to <hi>Daniels</hi> prayer, being a bleſſed quieting of his ſpirit, and to the event alſo. And indeed, one principal thing that makes this place ſo knotty, is in a manner but a trifle, <hi>viz. making a half point betwixt the ſeven weeks, and the ſixty two weeks, where none ſhould be made, and neglecting a Coma at the end of the ſixty two weeks, where for the more eaſie underſtanding of the words its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite one ſhould be.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now, as for the Reaſon why the ſeventy weeks, which firſt are mentioned whole, verſ. 24. are afterwards broken into parts, I conceive it to be this onely, <hi>That hereby the myſtery of this Propheſie might be the greater, and the time the harder to compute, which otherwiſe</hi> (the Head of the ſeventy once found) <hi>would have had no difficulty in it;</hi> therefore, that the myſtery might be ſo much the greater, we have the ſeventy weeks, which are firſt mentioned whole, broken into three parts, two ſmaller, and one greater, which are expreſſed ſeverally; firſt, ſeven weeks, then ſixty two weeks, then one week, verſ. 27.
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:115824:121"/>and that too in ſuch a manner, as if the ſeven weeks had relation to one thing, the ſixty two to another, the one, to another; whereas it is not ſo, but all put together make up but that ſeventy we had before, and ſerve to point us to the time of our Saviours Paſſion, which is ſaid, verſ. 26. to be after ſixty two weeks, that is, ſixty two ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the other ſeven, making ſixty nine; then, <hi>viz.</hi> at the end of ſixty nine weeks, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſeventieth, is our Redeemer anointed to his work: Hence that Character of the ſeventy weeks, verſ. 24. <hi>Seventy weeks are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to anoint the moſt Holy.</hi> This day of his anointing, is the day of his appearance to <hi>Iſrael;</hi> being anointed, he goes forth the reſt of that ſeventieth week, till the time of his Death, preaching the Goſpel, doing good, healing thoſe that were ſick, caſting out Devils, &amp;c. And this I conceive to be the thing meant by his <hi>confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Covenant with many for one week,</hi> verſ. 27. And indeed this agrees excellently well to that of <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 15.8. <hi>Now I ſay, that Jeſus Chriſt was a Miniſter of the Circumciſion for the truth of God, to confirm the promiſes made unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> Chriſt himſelf by his own preaching muſt confirm the Covenant made with the Fathers, which (ſaith the Apoſtle) is the reaſon why he was made a Miniſter of the Circumciſion, <hi>i.e.</hi> a Miniſter under the Law. Now this he did in the beginning of the ſeventieth week, going about preaching the ſpace of three years, and but three, as is clear, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.32, 33. And this was
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:115824:122"/>till towards the middle of the week (<hi>i.e.</hi> till four years before the four hundred and ninety were fully expired) at which time he was cut off, which I take to be the meaning of thoſe words, <hi>In the midſt of one week ſhall he cauſe the ſacrifice and the oblation to ceaſe,</hi> verſ. 27. <hi>i.e.</hi> Chriſts Death which fell out, not in the end, but in the middle of the laſt and ſeventieth week, did put an end to all the Jewiſh Sacrifices and Worſhip; the Great Paſſcover being ſlain, all other Sacrifices termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in him.</p>
                           <p>And indeed that Chriſts Paſſion muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily fall out about the middle of the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth week, is clear, becauſe the Text ſpeaks po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively that it ſhould be but <hi>ſeven weeks, and ſixty two weeks, i.e.</hi> ſixty nine weeks, <hi>untill the Meſſiah ſhall appear;</hi> So ſoon therefore as ever the ſixty nine weeks were at an end, and the ſeventieth but begun, we muſt of neceſſity conclude the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah did appear, for otherwiſe it ſhould be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of ſixty nine weeks to his appearance. Now the thing which will make all clear is, what we are to underſtand by <hi>his Appearance.</hi> We may not underſtand his Birth; for if ſo, then he not being put to death till he was four and thirty years old, which ſpace of time contains almoſt five of <hi>Daniels</hi> weeks, it ſhould be ſeventy three, or ſeventy four weeks to the cutting off of the Meſſiah, whereas the Text tells us he is cut off <hi>after</hi> ſixty nine weeks, or <hi>after</hi> ſeven weeks, and ſixty two weeks, which make ſixty nine.</p>
                           <p>I have in my <hi>Key, Theſ.</hi> 57. pitched upon the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:115824:122"/>time of his Baptiſme, but not ſo conſiderately, for though his Appearance then was to <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and ſome few Diſciples whom he choſe, yet did he not till afterwards appear publickly.</p>
                           <p>This <hi>Appearance</hi> of his, I do therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive (following herein the learned <hi>Mede</hi>) is to be reckoned <hi>from that time in which he begun to preach publickly to the Nation of the Jews, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelf to be the Meſſiah, which was</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> hath well noted) <hi>after his Harbinger</hi> John <hi>had now finiſhed his meſſage, and was caſt into priſon,</hi> which circumſtance of time is preciſely noted in the Evangelical ſtory, and the place alſo where he began his preaching, <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.14. <hi>After</hi> John <hi>was put in priſon Jeſus came into Galilee, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel of the Kingdome of God, and ſaying, The time is fulfilled, i.e.</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>) the laſt week of the ſixty two weeks is now come, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.12. compared with 17. This is the very time and place whence <hi>Peter</hi> reckoned the beginning of Chriſt's Prophecie in his Sermon to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> Act. 10.37. <hi>That word which was publiſhed throughout all</hi> Judaea, <hi>and began from</hi> Galilee, <hi>after the Baptiſm which</hi> John <hi>preached.</hi> And which is an evidence that this was the time of his anointing by his Father, <hi>Luke</hi> tells us Chap. 4.18, 19, 20, 21. <hi>That when he firſt opened the Book to teach the people in</hi> Nazareth <hi>of</hi> Galilee, <hi>he opened upon that place, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath anointed me to preach the Goſpel to the poor;</hi> Upon which Text our Saviour himſelf Comments, verſ. 21. <hi>This day is this
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:115824:123"/>Scripture fulfilled in your ears;</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, This day is <hi>Daniels</hi> ſeventieth week begun, now is the Meſſiah anointed; from this time (which according to Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> was a full year after Chriſts Baptiſm) we are to reckon thoſe three dayes or years, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.32, 33. To this opinion the ſeveral Paſſeovers betwixt Chriſts Baptiſm and Death, do beſt accord, which in caſe the Principle were as demonſtrable, as it is received and owned by good men, that of the Paſſeovers alone doth neceſſarily infer that four years muſt paſſe betwixt his Baptiſm and Death.</p>
                           <p>This opinion, though it differs from what I have laid down in my <hi>Key,</hi> yet is it ſo far from deſtroying my Harmony, that it ſuits it better then that doth; for by the addition of this year, the two thouſand three hundred dayes, and the one thouſand three hundred thirty five, do both fall at the end of the year one thouſand ſeven hundred and one; but according to the Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation there laid down, one falls at the beginning of the aforeſaid year, the other at the end. This being ſo, let it be conſidered how long it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſts beginning to preach, and his Paſſion, none will ſay it was ſeven years, the forequoted Text, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. ſhews it to be but three. And this no way repugns to <hi>Daniels</hi> half week; for the Scripture is not ſo curious in dividing as to go to the exactneſſe of a half week, it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that there is the half of the years contained in the week, though ſome few months be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:115824:123"/>And therefore well and conſiderately did, our Tranſlators render the half of the week, by the midſt of the week, which phraſe mollifie the rigor of Diviſion, and helps to remove the ſcruple that might otherwiſe ariſe through the want that there is, in this diviſion, of ſome few months. Now I ſay, Chriſt from the day of his anointing, which was at the very end of the ſixty ninth week, and in the beginning of the ſeventieth, preaching but three years, and then being cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, it neceſſarily follows, that his Paſſion muſt bee, not at the end, but in the midſt of the week, which week too can be no other then the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth and laſt. And therefore (as I have obſerved in my <hi>Key</hi>) it is ſaid, verſ. 26. <hi>after threeſcore and two weeks</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> ſixty two added to the ſeventy, making ſixty nine) <hi>ſhall the Meſſiah be cut off,</hi> and not after ſeventy weeks, becauſe Chriſts ſufferings came upon him before the ſeventieth week was fully and compleatly expired.</p>
                           <p>And upon theſe reaſons I have concluded in my <hi>Key, Theſ.</hi> 57. that we are not to account upon ſo many years fully as there are dayes in ſeventy weeks, but to deduct four out of the ſeventieth and laſt week, becauſe Chriſts ſufferings (which are the point where the ſeventy weeks expire) fell out to be in the very cloſe of the third day or year of the ſeventieth and laſt week.</p>
                           <p>And indeed it is an Argument of Gods ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care, that he ſhould leave in this Propheſie, ſuch clear hints, to prove that we are to cut off four years of the 70<hi rend="sup">th</hi> week, without which wee ſhould
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:115824:124"/>have run on to the end of it, and ſo computed four years more then we ought; which, beſides the breach that hereby would be made in Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology, would have made this Prophecie irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable with the reports of the ſeveral Evangeliſts as touching the time that paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſts Anointing and Paſſion.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Object.</hi> But it is ſaid, verſ. 27. <hi>He ſhall confirm the Covenant with many for one Week;</hi> Which one week can bee no other but the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventieth and laſt; for it is ſpoken of as a week diſtinct from the ſeven weeks, and the ſixty two weeks; If therefore after ſixty nine weeks are paſſed, one week is ſpent in confirming the Covenant, then muſt we needs place the Death of Chriſt, which was his laſt and ſealing act, not in the midſt, but in the end of the ſeventieth week.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not ſo, for under the Phraſe, One week, is not comprehended the whole week, but the half onely; and this is clear from the next words, <hi>in the midſt of the week ſhall he cauſe the Sacrifice, and Oblation to ceaſe.</hi> In the midſt of what week? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Of the one week, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt's Death muſt fall in the midſt or half (though not the exact half) of the one week; and if ſo, muſt not be brought down to the end of that week. If it be ſaid, The half week is to be underſtood of the latter half, and that it is the error of the Tranſlators, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the half of the week, by the middeſt of the week, for it may as well bee taken for the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:115824:124"/>latter half, as the former. To that I anſwer; If ſo, then doubtleſſe the Angel would have ſaid in the end of the week, and not in the half of the week; for the one is a proper phraſe, the other improper; the one leaves the thing without ſcruple, the other leaves a knot where none would look for any; for who would ever imagine, that the Angel, whilſt hee ſpeaks of a half of the week, ſhould mean the end. Nay, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be otherwiſe, but that that which is here called one week, muſt bee the former half only, and no more, for this reaſon, becauſe the work to bee done in the one week, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the Covenant.</p>
                           <p>Now this confirming the Covenant, being the higheſt act of Chriſt, as hee was a Miniſter of the Circumciſion, it neceſſarily follows, that Chriſt could do this no longer then within that time that he was laying out himſelf in his Miniſterial Function.</p>
                           <p>This confirming the Covenant cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be a work of ſeven years durance (which muſt bee, if wee take the one week for a full week) but of three only, which agrees well to half of a week, and (for what I have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) the former half.</p>
                           <p>If any be curious to know the reaſon why it ſhould bee called, One week, and yet but half a week only meant thereby?</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is with reſpect to the ſeventy weeks, ſixty nine of which hee had already reckoned in two parts, firſt ſeven weeks, then ſixty two;
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:115824:125"/>now becauſe the ſeventieth week, which in the groſſe ſumme was reckoned, had not yet in the parts been mentioned, hee therefore now brings that in, calling it one week, yet with lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down ſuch Cautions and Conſiderations, as that wee may well perceive, this one week, though called a week (with a reſpect to the other weeks of the ſeventy, that it is in the groſſe ſum conjoyned with) is not indeed to bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of a whole week, but the firſt half only.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Object.</hi> But if the cutting off of the Meſſiah bee in the middle of the week, how then are there <hi>ſeventy weeks determined on the Holy City?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>For anſwer. Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> hath a Notion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this, worthy to be written in Letters of gold; Onely he applies it to his opinion, <hi>viz. That the ſeventy weeks are to end with the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of</hi> Jeruſalem. So much as concerns that I ſhall alter in reciting it. The Notion ſpeaks thus; It ſhould be obſerved (though it uſeth not ſo to be) that the Angel reckons not by ſingle years, but by weeks; If he had ſaid there ſhould be four hundred and ninety years to the Paſſion of Chriſt, then indeed to make good the prediction, Chriſt muſt have ſuffered in the laſt year: But when he ſayes it ſhall bee ſeventy weeks, it is enough if ſo be Chriſt ſuffer in the ſeventieth week. For if thoſe who reckon by years, if the year deſigned anſwers the event, will not ſtand upon the compleatneſſe of months and dayes; nor
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:115824:125"/>thoſe who reckon by dayes, upon the compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of hours and minutes; no more in the Angels reckoning here by weeks, if ſo be the number of the weeks be compleat, are the parts of a week to be exacted. Seeing therefore the Text is clear, that the Meſſiah is to bee cut off in the ſeventieth week, it matters not as to the making up of ſeventy weeks, though the thing were done in the middle of the week; for ſufficient it is, that the ſame is done in the ſeventieth week.</p>
                           <p>Thus the ſundry great knots, as touching the ſeven weeks, the ſixty two weeks, the one week, and the half week, are all untied by this opinion, which ends the ſeventy weeks with the Paſſion of Chriſt, which no other opinion in a way agreeable to the Text, other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yea reaſon it ſelf, either hath done, or can do.</p>
                           <p>By this therefore we are yet farther confirmed in our foregoing Poſition, <hi>viz. That we are, with the Paſſion of our dear Lord and Saviour, to end</hi> Daniels <hi>Seventy Weeks.</hi>

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:115824:126"/>looks farther, and treats of things that relate to another time; For verſ. 26. mention is made of the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> both City and Sanctuary, which was performed many years after Chriſts death by <hi>Titus Veſpaſian, The people of the Prince that ſhall come ſhall deſtroy the City and Sanctuary, and the end thereof ſhall bee with a Flood.</hi> Yea the following words in the very ſame verſe, <hi>Unto the end of the War deſolations are determined,</hi> relate to a time much lower, according to the Expoſition I my ſelf have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of them, <hi>Key, Theſ.</hi> 17.

Therefore muſt not the ſeventy weeks end as before, but bee extended to ſome farther time.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſw.</hi> The foregoing Expreſſions, though they come within the compaſſe of the Viſion, yet not within the compaſſe of the ſeventy weeks; or thus, Though they are a part of the words of the Prophecie, yet are they no part of the ſeventy weeks; that is, They
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:115824:126"/>do not relate to things done within this time, but things to bee done afterwards, when the ſeventy weeks ſhould bee expired. For ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, The Angel having informed <hi>Daniel,</hi> that after ſeven weeks, and ſixty two weeks (<hi>i. e.</hi> ſixty nine) to bee reckoned from the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of the Command to reſtore and to build <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Meſſiah ſhould appear, who having confirmed the Covenant part of the ſeventieth week, ſhould in the middeſt of that week bee cut off, by which Death of his, hee ſhould put an end to the Moſaical worſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hee now goes on relating farther, what ſhould befall the Jewes hereupon, even untill their laſt Reſtoration, not any longer ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things as referring to the ſeventy weeks (to the end of which hee was come already) but as ſuiting the former Diſcourſe, and alſo anſwering <hi>Daniels</hi> deſire, which was, to know the final iſſue of things concerning his own people; and therefore the Angel tells him, that the Meſſiah being cut off, the Jews City and Sanctuary ſhould thereupon be deſtroyed, the body of their Nation bee made deſolate, in which deſolate, forlorn, unchurched condition, they ſhould remain even unto the time of the end, when Chriſt notwithſtanding all their unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to him, would yet make himſelf known unto them, taking that poor deſolate people into his arms and favour again; and this laſt of their Reſtoration ſeems to mee to bee the thing hinted in the very laſt words of the Prophecie,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:115824:127"/>and that determined ſhall bee poured upon the deſolate, <hi>i.e.</hi> (as I conceive, otherwiſe nothing at all is here ſpoken of their Reſtoration) That de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined One, <hi>viz.</hi> the Chriſt, the Meſiah, the determined time of whoſe firſt coming was ſeventy weeks, and who accordingly at the end of that time did come, was cut off by the Jews, <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſälem</hi> for this deſtroyed, they made deſolate, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churched, untill the conſummation, ſhall in the conſummation, or in the time of the end, bee poured upon the deſolate, that is, reveal himſelf unto, pour out his Spirit upon, this deſolate Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who now ſhall ſee and confeſſe, that that act of their Fore-fathers in crucifying Chriſt, was indeed the cutting off of their Meſſiah, or that determined One promiſed to them at the end of ſeventy weeks.</p>
                           <p>Thus though the Propheſie it ſelf brings us as low as Chriſts ſecond coming, yet are not the ſeventy weeks to be brought down thither; but we are to end them, as before, with the Paſſion of Chriſt; and whatſoever expreſſions have a farther look, we are to interpret them not as having a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the ſeventy weeks (which are compleat without them) but as ſpoken to this end, to give <hi>Daniel</hi> information how the caſe ſhould ſtand with his people, between the time of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection for the cutting off of the Meſſiah (where ends the ſeventy weeks) and their Reſtoration.</p>

He ſeems to have been a very ſtranger to the ſtate of the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> affairs, and therefore receiving Letters about them, cauſeth the Chronicles to be ſearched, <hi>Ezra</hi> 4.19. to finde what manner of people the <hi>Iews</hi> had been: now it is not likely that <hi>Cyrus</hi> Son ſhould be ſuch a ſtranger to this People, their State, and Affairs, whom his Father knew ſo well, and he ſucceeding his Father (according to Doctor <hi>Light-foot</hi>) after his Father had reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed three years. 2. He ſeems likewiſe to have
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:115824:129"/>been altogether unacquainted with <hi>Cyrus</hi> decree, which <hi>Cyrus</hi> Son was not; for how could he, and yet hinder it whilſt his Father was alive? But this <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was, which the Adverſaries knew well enough, or undoubtedly durſt not otherwiſe have charged the <hi>Iews</hi> with building a City, when themſelves knew it was but a Temple, leſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they ſhould give the King occaſion to reply, What now, are they building a City? I am ſure my Father <hi>Cyrus</hi> never decreed that; and ſo by this, their craft and malice ſhould come out.</p>
                           <p>All the colour that I finde in Doctor <hi>Light-foot</hi> for this opinion, is, That <hi>Cyrus</hi> Son was a hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and ſo was this <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> p. 190. But doth it therefore follow he muſt needs be <hi>Cyrus</hi> Son? might not <hi>Cyrus</hi> Son be one hinderer, and this <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> another after him? which is the more likely opinion for the Reaſons before gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                           <p>Now in caſe this Link prove weak, the Chain is eaſily broken: for if between <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes</hi> did reign any other King, then will the years betwixt <hi>Cyrus</hi> firſt, and the twentieth of the other <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> be more then thirty ſeven.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 <hi>Particular,</hi> That <hi>Artaxerxes Ahaſuerus</hi> reigned but fourteen years in all.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is the grant of Doctor <hi>Light-foot,</hi> that <hi>Artaxerxes Ahaſuerus,</hi> Ezra 4. is the ſame with that <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> we read of in <hi>Eſther,</hi> upon which grant (as ſufficient for us) we ſhall at preſent go, leaving the proof of the thing to another place; now let us by this rule examine the Poſition. We read in <hi>Eſther</hi> that full thirteen years of <hi>Ahaſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
                              <pb n="230" facs="tcp:115824:130"/>reign were run out in that very Month where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Iews</hi> cut off their enemies in <hi>Shuſhan,</hi> and elſewhere, as is evident. Compare Chap. 3.7. with Chap. 9.1. He hath then from this day (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Doctor <hi>Light-foots</hi> account) but one year more to reign.</p>
                           <p>Now let it bee obſerved what after this was done, and ſee whether or no the thing were likely to be compaſſed in a year.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, <hi>Mordecai</hi> ſends Letters to all the <hi>Iews</hi> that were in all the Provinces of King <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> farre and near to eſtabliſh the fourteenth, and fifteenth days of the Month <hi>Adar,</hi> as days of Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to be kept perpetually every year, Chap. 9.20, 21.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, The <hi>Iews</hi> of the ſeverall Provinces receive theſe Letters, and upon receipt aſſemble together, Ordain, and Inſtitute for themſelves and poſterity, that theſe days ſhould be obſerved as <hi>Mordecai</hi> had written, ver. 23.26, 27, 28.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, The report of this is carried back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to <hi>Shuſhan</hi> from all quarters, and thereupon <hi>Eſther</hi> the Queen, and <hi>Mordecai</hi> the <hi>Iew,</hi> write Letters the ſecond time, and ſend to all the <hi>Iews,</hi> in the one hundred and twenty ſeven Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to confirm what upon receipt of <hi>Mordecai's</hi> firſt Letters they had decreed for themſelves and their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>eed, ver. 29, 30, 31.</p>
                           <p>Now obſerve, the Dominions of <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver which the <hi>Iews</hi> were ſcattered, were ſo vaſt and large, that when upon <hi>Eſthers</hi> Petition a Counter-decree was to be ſent forth to put ſtop to the Decree of <hi>Haman,</hi> although the ſending of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:115824:130"/>it fotth was ſeven or eight Months before the time <hi>Hamans</hi> Decree was to have been put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, as will appear by comparing Chap. 8.9. with Chap. 9.1. yet leſt through the length of the way it ſhould come too late, <hi>Mordecai</hi> ſends Poſts on Horſ-back every way, and that upon ſwift Beaſts, Chap. 8.10. and withall they go forth haſtned and preſſed on, verſ. 14. Now if in ſeven Months time by ſwift running Poſts there could hardly be a conveyance of a Meſſage into all parts of <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> Dominions, how can we imagine that afterwards, when Letters were ſent forth not thus haſtned, but more leaſurely, they ſhould be conveyed all over <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the <hi>Iews</hi> thereupon from ſeveral parts meet together, hold a Council, inſtitute a Day to be kept by themſelves and poſterity, and the report of this when done returned again to the Court from all parts, and upon this, new Letters by way of ratification of their proceedings ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain from the Court to the <hi>Iews</hi> thorow-out all the one hundred twenty ſeven Provinces, and all this within the ſpace of one year.</p>
                           <p>Adde hereto, That the greatneſs of <hi>Mordecai</hi> under this <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> Chap. 10. his being accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the multitude of his Brethren, his ſeeking and endeavouring, as before their deliverance, ſo now the wealth of his People, his ſpeaking peace to all his Seed, ſeems clearly to argue that theſe things were not of one years continuance, but of a longer time. Such choyce mercies given of God to his people, eſpecially after ſuch bitter ſtorms, are not uſually ſo ſhort lived.</p>
                           <pb n="232" facs="tcp:115824:131"/>
                           <p>This ſtone removed, the building goes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, for in caſe <hi>Artaxerxes Ahaſuerus</hi> reigned but one year more then fourteen, then will there bee found upwards of thirty ſeven years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the firſt of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and the twentieth of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes.</hi>

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:115824:132"/>afterwards by <hi>Darius,</hi> and two more after that by <hi>Artaxerxes;</hi> and becauſe <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> had in a more eſpecial manner been Benefactor to <hi>Ezra,</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> in his time, therefore <hi>Ezra,</hi> upon occaſion of relating the ſtory of the finiſhing of the Houſe, having made mention of the other two, <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Darius,</hi> will not paſſe over <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> but by anticipation names him before, though his Story come not in till afterward; not ſo much minding the curioſity of that particular Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether all three had been forwarders of that particular work of building Gods Houſe, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intent to expreſſe the truth of the matter in generall, viz. That all three, <hi>Cyrus, Darius,</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> had been friends to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers of Gods work among them.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 Becauſe <hi>Ezra,</hi> coming up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the 7th of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> findes a High Prieſt, who was Grand-child to him that was High Prieſt in the 6th of <hi>Darius,</hi> when the Temple-work was finiſhed; <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> being then High Prieſt, but one <hi>Eliaſhib</hi> is now High Prieſt; compare <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.6. with <hi>Neh.</hi> 3.20, 21 True, <hi>Ezra</hi> cals not <hi>Eliaſhib</hi> High Prieſt at this time, as doth <hi>Nehemiah</hi> afterwards; yet no other High Prieſt being mentioned, and withall <hi>Eliaſhib</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo aged that he had then a Son, a Prieſt, viz. <hi>Johanan, Ezra.</hi> 10.6. it is very probable he was at this time High Prieſt.

                           <p n="3">3 Becauſe <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> Chap. 5.15. makes mention of Governours to have been in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> before his time, that had oppreſſed the people, and that did not fear God; for in this he oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelf to them, he feared God, therefore did not ſo as thoſe former Governours.

Theſe unjuſt oppreſſing Governours muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ſuppoſed to bear rule betwixt <hi>Zerubba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi> time and <hi>Ezraes;</hi> and if ſo, then cannot we think with Doctor <hi>Light-foot</hi> the time ſhould be ſo little as one year; if more, then of neceſſity muſt <hi>Darius</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> be two diſtinct per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</p>

                           <p>Now this which is the main Foundation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone not being firm, the building muſt needs be weak: for if <hi>Darius</hi> were one perſon, and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes</hi> another, then put caſe <hi>Darius</hi> dyed that very year the Temple was finiſhed, which is a thing very unlikely, conſidering he craved the prayers of Gods people, unto whom he had been ſuch a friend, that he might live long, <hi>Ezra</hi> 6.11. And alſo ſuppoſe <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> his next Succeſſor, yet becauſe <hi>Ezraes</hi> going up is not till <hi>Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes</hi> ſeventh year, there will be upon the reſult ſix years more then Doctor <hi>Light-foot</hi> hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for, which makes ſuch a breach in his building as cannot be made up again.</p>

                              <hi>Anſ.</hi> This I muſt confeſſe, look upon it one way, it ſeems to have in it much ſtrength, yet look upon it another, and it ſeems altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable; for, according to this reckoning, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>Ezra</hi> to be born but the year before <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lems</hi> deſtruction, when his Father was ſlain, yet muſt we (as ſaith Doctor <hi>Light-foot</hi> himſelf) ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him fifty years old at leaſt in that very year which the Scripture calls <hi>Cyrus</hi> firſt; Now laying hereunto Doctor <hi>Light-foots</hi> own words upon <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13. which are theſe, <hi>Ezra</hi> (ſaith he) lived near the times of <hi>Jaddua,</hi> who met <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the Great coming to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for he wrote the Book of <hi>Chronicles</hi> in the time of <hi>Iohanan Iad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duaes</hi> Father, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 12.23. and ſo he lived well towards the expiration of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy. Now let us lay all together and weigh the whole; <hi>Ezra</hi> was fifty years old in <hi>Cyrus</hi> firſt year, after that he muſt out-live four generations, and in the fifth generation write the Book of the <hi>Chronicles;</hi> that four generations (though Doctor <hi>Light-foot</hi> doth not obſerve it) did paſſe betwixt the firſt of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and the days of <hi>Iohanan Iadduaes</hi> father, is evident, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 12.10, 11. <hi>And</hi> Jeſhua <hi>begat</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jakim, Jojakim <hi>alſo begat</hi> Eliaſhib, <hi>and</hi> Eliaſhib <hi>begat</hi> Jojada, <hi>and</hi> Jojada <hi>begat</hi> Jonathan, <hi>and</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan <hi>begat</hi> Jaddua Now obſerve, <hi>Ieſhua</hi> was High Prieſt in the firſt year of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> Ezra 3.2. <hi>Ezra</hi> out-lives him, there is one generation; <hi>Jojakim</hi> ſucceeded him, there is a ſecond; <hi>Eliaſhib</hi> him, there was a
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:115824:134"/>third; <hi>Jojada</hi> him, there was a fourth. All theſe <hi>Ezra</hi> out-lived, and in the fifth generation, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Johanan</hi> or <hi>Jonathan Jadduaes</hi> Father, hee wrote the Book of the <hi>Chronicles;</hi> he muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore certainly be very aged, that after fifty years of age ſhould out-live four generations, and live to ſee the fifth; yet this did <hi>Ezra</hi> in caſe hee were Son to that <hi>Serajah.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>It is therefore (Iconceive) much better to ſay, that that <hi>Serajah,</hi> the Son of <hi>Azariah,</hi> the Son of <hi>Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> — mentioned <hi>Ezra</hi> 7.1. was not immediate Father to <hi>Ezra,</hi> but rather Grand-father, or Great Grand-father; now <hi>Ezra</hi> coming out of his Loyns is called his Son, though he were not the immediate Son, or next Iſſue, for one of theſe Reaſons.</p>
                           <p>Either firſt, becauſe that <hi>Serajah</hi> was more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſſy known, being High Prieſt, and killed at the ſacking of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> then poſſibly <hi>Ezraes</hi> next Father was, and therefore <hi>Ezra</hi> paſſeth over him in ſilence, and begins his Deſcent from the other, who was more famouſly known.</p>
                           <p>Or ſecondly, becauſe that <hi>Serajah</hi> was the firſt in the Line of <hi>Ezra</hi> upwards that was High Prieſt: for though others did come betwixt <hi>Ezra</hi> and him, yet were none of them High Prieſts; for the Prieſt-hood from <hi>Serajah</hi> went on in another Line, not that of <hi>Ezraes</hi> Father, but that of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſadaz</hi> (or <hi>Ioſedech</hi>) father of <hi>Ieſhua,</hi> 1 Chron. 6.14, 15. <hi>Ezraes</hi> Father therefore, though he came of the Houſe of <hi>Aaron,</hi> yet becauſe he was not of <hi>Aarons</hi> Line he paſſeth him over, beginning his Genealogie from the firſt of his Anceſtors
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:115824:134"/>that was of that Line, namely <hi>Serajah.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Or Thirdly (which I rather incline to) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is very probable <hi>Ezraes</hi> immediate Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was alſo named <hi>Serajah,</hi> and becauſe the name of Father, and Grand-father, or Great Grand-father was the ſame, he therefore in counting his Pedigree paſſeth over his Father, and ſuch other (if any did come between) as paſſed betwixt him and <hi>Serajah,</hi> and begins (as I have ſaid) from him. Now a like example to this we have in the very text, <hi>Ezra</hi> 7. if we compare it with 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.4. to 15. for in the Genealogie, as we have it in <hi>Ezra,</hi> we finde betwixt <hi>Shallum</hi> and <hi>Merarioth</hi> but four generations, viz. of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dok,</hi> of <hi>Ahitub,</hi> of <hi>Amariah,</hi> of <hi>Azariah;</hi> but in the very ſame Genealogie as it is laid down in the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> we have betwixt theſe two no leſſe then ten Generations; And what is the reaſon hereof? Why this; we have in the <hi>Chronicles</hi> between <hi>Shallum</hi> and <hi>Merarioth</hi> two <hi>Zadoks,</hi> two <hi>Ahitubs,</hi> two <hi>Amariahs,</hi> two <hi>Azariahs;</hi> now <hi>Ezra</hi> in his Genealogie to ſhun repetitions, contents himſelf with naming each one, and then leaps over the reſt of the ſame name. Now as I ſaid, <hi>Ezraes</hi> Father being in all likelihood na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Serajah,</hi> that <hi>Ezra</hi> might not come over with the ſame name twice, he therefore omits him, and begins with that <hi>Serajah,</hi> who yet was more remote, carrying on his Pedigree from him. And that the thing I have ſaid, viz. That <hi>Ezraes</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was named <hi>Serajah,</hi> yet not <hi>Serajah</hi> the High Prieſt, hath in it a probability, is clear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Nichem.</hi> 11.11. we read of one <hi>Serajah,</hi>
                              <pb n="240" facs="tcp:115824:135"/>which could not be <hi>Serajah</hi> the High Prieſt, who was ſlain long before, but this <hi>Serajah</hi> was then living, and dwelling in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his Line is the very ſame with <hi>Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raes,</hi> for he is Son of <hi>Hilkiah,</hi> Son of <hi>Meſhullam,</hi> (or <hi>Shallum</hi>) Son of <hi>Zadok,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore in all likelihood no other but <hi>Ezraes</hi> Father.</p>
                           <p>And here again obſerve as a further confirmation of the thing before noted, viz. That becauſe the ſame name ſhould not be brought over twice, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is <hi>Serajah</hi> the High Prieſt here paſſed over, and all betwixt him and <hi>Nehemiahs Serajah;</hi> and the Pedigree of this <hi>Serajah</hi> begins with <hi>Hilkiah,</hi> the Son of <hi>Shallum,</hi> the Son of <hi>Zadok,</hi> though yet <hi>Hilkiah</hi> was not immediate Father to this <hi>Serajah,</hi> but at a great diſtance ſeparated from him two or three generations at leaſt; two we read of, <hi>Ezra</hi> 7.1. viz. <hi>Serajah</hi> the High Prieſt, and <hi>Azariah,</hi> which both come betwixt <hi>Nehemiahs Serajah</hi> and <hi>Hilkiah.</hi> I ſay therefore, that it is a thing very likely, that <hi>Ezraes</hi> immediate Father was named <hi>Serajah,</hi> and for the reaſon he would not come twice over with the ſame name, and the former reaſons put together, he therefore paſſeth him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and begins more upwards in his Line, viz. with <hi>Serajah</hi> the High Prieſt, which is a thing more probable by farre, then to imagine that <hi>Ezra</hi> who was fifty years old in the firſt of <hi>Cyrits,</hi> ſhould afterwards out-live four Generations, and in the Fifth be a Writer of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> as doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow upon Doctor <hi>Light-foots</hi> opinion; yea that he who was fifty years old when the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Monarchy began, ſhould live (as ſaith Doctor
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:115824:135"/>
                              <hi>Lightfoot</hi>) till towards the expiration of it; which conſidering that the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy laſted two hundred years, it beginning (ſaith <hi>Helvicus</hi>) in the ſixty ſecond <hi>Olympiad,</hi> and ending in the one hundred and twelfth, now to each <hi>Olympiad</hi> four years being allowed (which is the rule of compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation by <hi>Olympiads</hi>) the fiftie <hi>Olympiads</hi> of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Monarchy make up the even ſum of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, which is a term ſo long, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding with God nothing is impoſſible, yet to me it ſeems very improbable, That <hi>Ezra,</hi> a man fifty years old at the beginning of this time, ſhould live towards or near the end of it. This very number of years I confeſſe is not mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Scripture; yet however the fore-going Text aſſuring us this Monarchy laſted no leſſe then five generations, we may well conclude the time could not be much leſſe:</p>
                           <p n="6">6 <hi>Particular,</hi> That the deſign of the Holy Choſt, in <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> is to give us a Chronicle of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſ.</hi> This cannot I conceive, but judge the contrary, viz. That the deſign of the Holy Ghoſt is another thing, namely, to record the ſtate of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> affairs, not in the leaſt intending a Chronicle of the Kings of <hi>Perſia;</hi> and my reaſon is, becauſe the Scripture hath not aſcertained us that <hi>Artaxerxes Ahaſuerus</hi> was next Succeſſor to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> nor <hi>Darius</hi> to him, nor hath it told us how long any one of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings did reign, and therefore it ſeems very unlikely that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment of the Holy Ghoſt ſhould be to give us a Chronicle of the times, and yet leave us alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:115824:136"/>in the dark, as to the perſons that reigned, and the time how long.</p>
                           <p>Nay, what need was there of continuing the ordinary Scripture Chronicle any further then the end of the ſeventy years Captivity? ſeeing with the firſt of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> where the ſeventy years expire, we have a Divine Chronologie left us of the whole of the time from that very year, until the ſecond coming of Chriſt; if therefore we have but ſufficient left us in the Scripture to make out upon ſure grounds this account, viz. of the two thouſand three hundred years, we need not after once they are begun, carry on the Scripture Chronicle upon any other foot but this only, of the two thouſand three hundred years. By the help of which number, being ordered by a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful hand of Providence, there to begin where the ſeventy years of the Captivity ended, (after which we are altogether in the dark, as to the queſtions, Who reigned, or how long? having nothing (were this number thrown aſide) to build our ſaith upon but Human reports) we have a certain Scripture Chronologie from the very day of the Creation untill the day of Chriſts ſecond coming. Thoſe know not what they loſe, nor indeed what inconvenience in this reſpect they draw upon themſelves, who would have theſe two thouſand three hundred days to be Natural days; nor that Author nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who would have but half ſo many years underſtood as there are days, ſo fixing the head of this number downwards very low in the times of the New Teſtament; for ſeeing <hi>Daniels</hi>
                              <pb n="243" facs="tcp:115824:136"/>four hundred and ninety years cannot be begun with the firſt of <hi>Cyrus</hi> (as I have proved before) but do begin with the twentieth of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> let it be ſhewn from any other Scripture (this Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and the Argument lying in it, being ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide) the certain number of years betwixt <hi>Cyrus</hi> firſt, and the twentieth of <hi>Artaxerxes;</hi> if this can be done, I am wonderouſly miſtaken, and I think I may be bold to ſay it cannot; If it be not done, I am ſure then the very grounds of Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologie will be fallible; and if ſo, what may we expect the Concluſions will be? Well there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (if all be conſidered) may this number go under the title of the account of the Wonderful Numberer, as <hi>Daniel</hi> calls it.</p>
                           <p>By this I am further confirmed in my begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the two thouſand three hundred years, that I have begun them aright, in beginning them with the firſt of <hi>Cyrus;</hi> and that they may not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun either higher or lower for what need have we of beginning them with the beginning of <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzars</hi> Tyranny over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſeeing the duration of that is ſet forth by another number of Seventy years, to the end of which Seventy years the grounds of Chronologers are perfect, without a ſupply from this? to carry this therefore up into that time is ſuperfluous.</p>
                           <p>Again, ſhould we begin them lower then the firſt of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> then becauſe we have no other Scripture-ground to go upon but this only, for many years that followed, a defect will be (as I have ſaid) in the very foundation of Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie. Seeing therefore we may not begin them
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:115824:137"/>either higher or lowet, the beginning we have ſtated, and that only is the truth.</p>
                           <p>From all that hath been ſaid, it appears, that Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi>'s Suppoſitions, are but Suppoſitions, not having in them the force of Arguments to uphold the thing they would countenance; Nay, the very things themſelvs, look upon them in our Anſwers, do clearly argue the time betwixt <hi>Cyrus</hi> firſt, and <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> twentieth, to be much more then ſeven and thirty years.</p>
                           <p>Beſides, Dr. <hi>Lightfoots</hi> ſuppoſitory grounds, ſomething farther of a like nature may be urged, which ſeems to argue that the time betwixt <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> firſt, and <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> twentieth year, could not be long. As</p>
                           <p>Firſt, the names of thoſe who ſealed the Covenant with <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> Chap. 10. are many of them the very ſame with the names found in the Regiſter of thoſe who came up with <hi>Zerubba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> Ezra. 2. it ſeems therefore that thoſe perſons were now living, if ſo, then cannot the time be eſteemed long.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſ.</hi> The names, <hi>Ezra</hi> 2. and again <hi>Nehem.</hi> 10. are not names of men, as particular perſons, but as Heads of Families, for which cauſe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons mentioned by name, are called the chief of the People, the Princes, Nobles, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.38. Chap. 10.14.29. Hence the Head of the Family of <hi>Paroſh,</hi> goes under the name of <hi>Paroſh</hi> (as he was a publick perſon, and Head of a Family ſo called) in the generation <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> lived in, and alſo afterwards in <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> generation. Not that <hi>Paroſh</hi> (and ſo of all the reſt) ſignifies in
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:115824:137"/>both one and the ſame particular perſon, but indeed the Head or common perſon of one and the ſame Family, which (that the diſtinction of Families hereby might be the more conſpicuous, and the better preſerved) is called <hi>Paroſh</hi> in <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubbabels</hi> time, and <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> likewiſe, though theſe two were ſeparated at leaſt a generation from each other, as I have already obſerved. And that it is a thing ordinary to give to a publick perſon, whether Prince, or Noble-man, as Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe, Earl, &amp;c. beſides his own proper name (which is peculiar to him) a name common to him, and all that do, or ſhall ſucceed him in his place, as ſuch, is a thing we cannot be ignorant of. And alſo (which is the thing to be minded) as ſuch a one who is a publick perſon in all his publick actions, layes by his private name, and acts by vertue of his name as ſuch; ſo the Heads of each Family acting as publick perſons; Firſt, In leading their Families forth out of <hi>Babylon</hi> in <hi>Zerubbabels</hi> time; Secondly, In ſealing the Covenant for themſelves, and the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily they were Heads of, in <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> time, they loſe their names as they were private men, and retain only that common name, which was given to them as publick perſons; and hence it comes to paſſe, that there is ſtill the uſe of the ſame names, though yet perſons and generations were different.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, The Regiſter mentioned <hi>Nehem.</hi> 7. doth ſomewhat vary, in reſpect of the number of perſons in ſundry of the Families, from that we read of <hi>Ezra</hi> 2. Now what may be the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:115824:138"/>reaſon hereof? Why, (ſaith Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> in his Harmony upon <hi>Nehem ah, page</hi> 204.) <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> Regiſter is a Regiſter of the perſons as they were then living in his time; but <hi>Ezraes</hi> of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as they were at their firſt coming up with <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubbabel</hi> in the firſt year of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> And if ſo, then conſidering that the variation betwixt one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter and the other, is but ſmall, it will ſtrongly argue, that the time betwixt <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> could not be long.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Reaſon given by Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> is a miſtake, and againſt the Text, and will not reconcile each place; For obſerve, It is expreſly ſaid of <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> Regiſter Chap. 7. <hi>that the ſame was found by</hi> Nehemiah, yea and found ſo writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as he delivers it in the following verſes, verſ. 5. <hi>And my God put it into my heart to gather together the Nobles, and the Rulers, and the People, that they might be reckoned by Genealogre. And I found a Regiſter of the Genealogic of them which came up at the firſt, and found written therein, Theſe are the Children of the Province, &amp;c.</hi> The Regiſter therefore was not a Regiſter made up partly of the perſons then living, and partly of thoſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the old Regiſter, becauſe then the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter ſhould be of <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> making; but the Regiſter he ſpeaks of, was a Regiſter he ſound written to his hand. Nay, how can we think it ſhould be ſo, ſeeing it was upwards of ſeven and thirty years (in caſe we follow Dr. <hi>Lightfoots</hi> own reckoning) from the time <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> went up (when the firſt Regiſter was made) unto this time, which was after <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was come to
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:115824:138"/>
                              <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and had built the walls of the City? Now obſerve, as there is in moſt families mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in either Regiſter the very ſame number of perſons; ſo likewiſe is there in both Regiſters one and the ſame number of Horſes, Mules, Camels, Aſſes, as compare, <hi>Ezra</hi> 2.66, 67. with <hi>Nehem.</hi> 7.68, 69. Now who can beleeve it, that in ſeven and thirty years there ſhould not be diminiſhed, nor increaſed not one perſon in many Families, which Families too conſiſted ſome of divers hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of perſons, ſome of thouſands? Nor in ſo great a multitude, not one Horſe, nor a Mule? It is therefore more conſonant to truth, and will better reconcile each place, to ſay, That as <hi>Zerub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel</hi> at his firſt coming up drew that Regiſter, <hi>Ezra</hi> 2. So ſuddenly after, when by coming and going, ſome change and alteration was made of perſons, he drew a ſecond; which ſecond Liſt or Catalogue, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in ſearching lights upon, but miſſeth the firſt. And as this doth much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reconcile each place, ſo doth it no way injure us; Nay, that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> is fain to go to ſearch old Regiſters to find the Genealogie of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons then living, is an Argumeat rather that the former generation who came up with <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> was extinct, yea had been ſo ſome time (the perſons now living having in a manner for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten their deſcent) then that they ſhould be alive.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, <hi>Ezra</hi> is particularized by name, as being one of thoſe that came up at the firſt with <hi>Zerubbabel, Nehem.</hi> 12.1. it cannot therefore be, conſidering how active this <hi>Ezra</hi> was even in <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiahs</hi>
                              <pb n="248" facs="tcp:115824:139"/>dayes, that the diſtance of time betwixt <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſhould be very great.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſ.</hi> No Argument at all is, or can be fetched out of the Books of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> from the agreement or likelihood of names, unleſſe only in ſuch places, where beſides the bare name we have ſomething elſe laid down that carries proof with it, that we are by the ſame name alwayes to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the ſame particular perſon, and no other. And the reaſon is, becauſe it is a thing of moſt common uſe in theſe two Books, to give the ſame names to diverſe and ſundry perſons, as who conſults either book diligently ſhall find no leſſe then three or four different <hi>Jeſhuaes,</hi> and about ſome eight or nine diſtinct <hi>Zechariahs;</hi> four ſeveral <hi>Eliaſhibs,</hi> viz. <hi>Eliaſhib</hi> the High Prieſt, and three other of that name, we have in the tenth Chapter of <hi>Ezra</hi> only; Seven or eight diſtinct <hi>Shemiahs,</hi> and as many <hi>Meſhullams</hi> are recorded in theſe two books. Divers other like inſtances its moſt eaſie to produce. Whence it follows, that the uſe of the ſame name proves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all as to this or that particular perſon, in caſe there be not in the Text ſome other notation, which devolves the name upon this or that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as conſidered diſtinct from all others; As for example, When <hi>Jeſhua</hi> is called, either <hi>Jeſhua</hi> the High Prieſt, or <hi>Jeſhua</hi> the ſon of <hi>Jozadak,</hi> this is a manifeſt notation of the perſon, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing him from all others of that name; when <hi>Nehemiah</hi> is called <hi>Nehemiah</hi> the <hi>Tirſhatha,</hi> or the Governor, or <hi>Nehemiah</hi> the ſon of <hi>Hachaliah,</hi> this denotes the particular perſon, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:115824:139"/>him from that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> the ſon of <hi>Azbuk,</hi> Chap. 3.16. But now in the Text ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, we have only a bare name, without any other notation, and therefore it proves nothing. Nay, it is manifeſt from the Text, that that <hi>Ezra</hi> who is recorded as one of them that came up with <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> cannot be the <hi>Ezra</hi> ſo much ſpoken of in this Book; For obſerve, verſ. 12, 13, &amp;c. and we ſhall find, that in the dayes of <hi>Jojakim,</hi> who was Father to that <hi>Eliaſhib</hi> that was High Prieſt in the dayes of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> (as verſ. 10.) the <hi>Ezra</hi> who came up with <hi>Zerubba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> and alſo the <hi>Serajah,</hi> the <hi>Jeremiah, Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah,</hi> &amp;c. mentioned with him, verſ. 1, 2. were gone, and another generation were come up in their rooms, in the place of <hi>Serajah,</hi> we have now <hi>Merajah;</hi> of <hi>Jeremiah, Hananiah;</hi> of <hi>Ezra, Meſhullam;</hi> of <hi>Amariah, Jehohanan,</hi> and ſo of all the reſt; ſo that not only this <hi>Ezra</hi> is gone, but there is a change even of a whole generation in the dayes of <hi>Joiakim.</hi> And this <hi>Jojakim</hi> being fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Eliaſhib</hi> muſt needs be of the generation before <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> for in <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> dayes, <hi>Eliaſhib</hi> the ſon is High Prieſt, by conſequence therefore <hi>Jojakim</hi> was now dead. Now conſider, the <hi>Ezra</hi> who wrote the book of <hi>Ezra,</hi> lived and acted with <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> but the <hi>Ezra</hi> who came up with <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> was removed, and another in his place a generation before <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> dayes; therefore though the name is one, yet have we not one, but two perſons ſignified by it; the <hi>Ezra</hi> who came up with <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> was one, the <hi>Ezra</hi> who acted with <hi>Nehemiah</hi> another;
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:115824:140"/>and for this reaſon is this latter (as ſeems to me) called <hi>Ezra</hi> the Prieſt, the Scribe, verſ. 26. and <hi>Ezra</hi> the Scribe, verſ. 36. to diſtinguiſh him from the foregoing <hi>Ezra,</hi> verſ. 1.</p>
                           <p>From the whole it appears, that as Dr. <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foots</hi> Allegations ſingly are too weak, ſo theſe added to them (which (if I miſtake not) is the utmoſt that with colour of reaſon can be urged from Scripture-Text) will not help his opinion, to narrow the time betwixt <hi>Cyrus</hi> firſt, and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes</hi> twentieth into ſo little a compaſs as thirty ſeven years; nor will they maintain any other opinion whatſoever, that either is, or may be ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that doth or ſhall ſo ſhorten this time, as that the whole put together will not amount to more then one full age.</p>
                           <p>Yet with all let me ſay, when I conſider the whole, and how great a ſhew of reaſon there is (if things laid down in the Books of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> be taken up upon the firſt look) to cut this time ſhort, I do not at all wonder, that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers (whoſe averſneſſe to take up re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports from Heathens, though ever ſo true, and aptneſſe to look upon theſe Books as a Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle (a thing never intended by the Holy Ghoſt) and miſ-underſtanding the Story by taking up things too haſtily, might cauſe in them this error) ſhould adhere to this opinion of the ſhortneſſe of the time betwixt the firſt coming up from the Captivity, and <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> dayes, and that Dr. <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> Mr. <hi>Broughton,</hi> and others, ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them; for truly there ſeems at firſt bluſh, to be much more reaſon for ſuch an opinion, then
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:115824:140"/>any other; but when things are once throughly weighed, and well digeſted, the contrary is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, and an unprejudiced eye will eaſily ſee that this Thred muſt be drawn out ſomewhat more at length, then the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers, or Chronologers that adhere to them will allow of.</p>
                           <p>The Concluſion is, <hi>That the Opinion of Dr.</hi> Lightfoot, <hi>and others, who following the ſteps of the Jewiſh Writers do bring this time into a little ſcantling, is a miſtake, and not that certain rule by which we are to meaſure this Period.</hi>

                           <p>Now becauſe <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> (as alſo <hi>Darius</hi>) was a name common to more then one or two of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchs, we muſt therefore in order to the <hi>Principal Queſtion</hi> in the firſt place diſcuſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, viz.</p>
                           <p>Queſt. <hi>What</hi> Artaxerxes <hi>was that from whom</hi> Nehemiah <hi>received Commiſsion to build</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem?</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſ.</hi> That we may the better find out this, I ſhall firſt enquire, <hi>What</hi> Darius <hi>that was by whoſe order the Temple work was revived;</hi> for that <hi>Darius</hi> was Predeceſſor to this <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
                           <pb n="252" facs="tcp:115824:141"/>
                           <p n="1">1 From <hi>his place</hi> in the Story, we read of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, Ezra</hi> 5. but not of this <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> till after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 The Holy Ghoſt making a clear diſtinction betwxit <hi>Cyrus, Darius,</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes, placeth</hi> Artaxerxes <hi>after</hi> Darius, <hi>as</hi> being his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, as he doth <hi>Darius</hi> after <hi>Cyrus</hi> as his, <hi>Ezra</hi> 6.14.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 <hi>Ezra</hi> coming up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the ſeventh year of that very ſame <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> in whoſe twentieth <hi>Nehemiah</hi> received his Commiſſion, <hi>findes a Temple there,</hi> and did ſacrifiſe, <hi>Ezra</hi> 8.34, 35. therefore muſt this <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> be Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor to <hi>Darius,</hi> for untill the ſixth of <hi>Darius</hi> no Temple was built.</p>
                           <p>Nay, he was not only Succeſſor to him, but Succeſſor at ſuch a diſtance, as appears to me he was not his <hi>next Succeſſor,</hi> but rather <hi>next to his next,</hi> which is clear from that great change and alteration that there was in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church and State both, betwixt the ſixth year of the one, and the ſeventh of the other.</p>
                           <p n="1">1 In the Church, in the ſixth year of <hi>Darius, Jeſhua</hi> in all probability was alive, and High Prieſt, as lay theſe Scriptures together, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.14, 15.

                           <p n="2">2 In the State, there had been Governours that oppreſſed the people, and did not fear God, betwixt <hi>Zerubbabels</hi> time, who was Governour

                           <p>The queſtion here then will be,</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>What</hi> Darius <hi>was that who by his Decree did the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time ſet the Temple-work on foot?</hi>
                           </p>

                              <hi>Anſ.</hi> Some (and not a few) will have this <hi>Darius</hi> to be <hi>Darius Hyſtaſper,</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Cambyſes</hi> the Son of <hi>Cyrus</hi> in the Kingdom: But this cannot be, becauſe betwixt <hi>Cyrus</hi> and that <hi>Darius</hi> who ſet the Temple-work on foot, did reign <hi>one Artaxerxe,</hi> Ch. 4.7. by whom the work was hindred; but none ſuch reigned betwixt <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Darius Hystaſpes.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>To ſay (as do ſome) this <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> though recorded before, yet reigned after <hi>Darius,</hi> is ſo expreſly againſt the Text, that I cannot admit ſuch a thought, for the Copy of the Letters of <hi>Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes</hi> is the very thing which puts ſtop to the work of the Temple; for it ſeems the <hi>Jews</hi> upon the change that now was in the Empire, through the death of the Monarch that was, had by vertue of their old Commiſſion from <hi>Cyrus,</hi> ſet upon, anew of themſelves, the Temple-work, as hoping the new Prince would favour their enterprize; now the enemies ſeeing this, diſpatch away Letters in haſte to <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> containing a charge againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> who in anſwer returns them Letters, with a ſtrict command to go up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and cauſe the work to ceaſe, which upon receipt of, and reading the Kings Letter, they ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:115824:142"/>did, and thereupon the Work of God cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed untill the ſecond year of <hi>Darius,</hi> Ezra 4.23, 24. it is therefore a Queſtion without queſtion that <hi>Darius</hi> was Succeſſor to this <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> as he was Predeceſſor to the other.</p>
                           <p>Some others therefore perceiving that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer opinion will not agree with the Text, will have this <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> to be <hi>Cyrus</hi> Son, and next Succeſſor (commonly called by Hiſtorians <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſes</hi>) but this opinion is as unlikely as the other is untrue, as I have proved already in anſwer to Doctor <hi>Lightfoot.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>There is yet another opinion, which affirms this <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> to be <hi>Smerdis Magus,</hi> the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, who reigned ſeven Months betwixt <hi>Cambyſes</hi> and <hi>Darius Hyſtaſpes.</hi> But certainly had the ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Work of the Houſe of God been for no longer time then is given to it by this opinion, wch cannot be much above a year, if we conſider that <hi>Smerdis</hi> (as themſelves ſay) reigned but ſeven Months, out of which ſeven Months we muſt allow ſome time for the news of <hi>Cambyſes</hi> death, being brought to <hi>Judahs</hi> Adverſaries; ſome time more for their ſending their Letters, (which being ſubſcribed by ſo many ſundry people, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in ſundry places, as verſe ninth intimates, it is likely could not be much leſs time in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring) ſome more time for that ſearch of the Chronicles upon this Letter, verſ. 19. and ſome more yet for the Kings anſwer to them again; and conſidering withall that <hi>Darius Hyſtaſpes</hi> who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>Smordis,</hi> did (according to their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) in the ſecond year of his reign ſet the work
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:115824:142"/>on foot again; the whole compared together it will appear, that the work could not ceaſe very little more then one year; which time being ſo ſhort, it can hardly be thought that the Scripture would take notice of it, much leſſe with ſuch an Emphaſis, ſetting ſuch a mark upon this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as verſe laſt; <hi>Then ceaſed the Work of the Houſe of God, ſo it ceaſed untill the ſecond year of Darius.</hi> None that reads the words can think the ceſſation here ſpoken of was only a Twelve-months buſineſſe. I ſay not that the very ſtory of <hi>Smerdis</hi> (which though unto meer ſtories I give little credit, yet being the Adverſaries Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons I may uſe them) the which reports him all his time in a manner to have been ſhut up in his Chamber, neither daring to ſhew himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, nor admitting any to come to him, gives juſt ground of ſuſpition he could nor be this <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes,</hi> who ſeems by what is recorded of him in this Chapter, <hi>Ezra</hi> 4. to have been no ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired perſon, but of a more publick life.</p>
                           <p>But to put an end to this variety of opinions, I take it the Text it ſelf hath decieed the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, telling us plainly that this <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was no other then <hi>Ahaſuerus;</hi> he who is called <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> verſ. 7. being called <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> verſe 6. the perſon in both being one and the ſame; only the Holy Ghoſt having firſt made mention of the accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Judahs</hi> Adverſaries in the general, with a declaration of the time when they wrote it, <hi>viz.</hi> in the beginning of <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> reign, verſe ſix, proceeds to mention the ſame more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with the names of the Perſons that wrote it,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:115824:143"/>and a Copy of the Accuſation it ſelf, and what ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it had; in which following diſcourſe there is only a change of the name, he being now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> (a name common to many of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was to the <hi>Aegyptians</hi>) who had before been called <hi>Ahaſuerus.</hi> If you ask what <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> this was, I anſwer, The ſame in all likelihood that we read of throughout the Book of <hi>Heſter;</hi> for, ſetting aſide <hi>Heſters</hi> ſtory, we do not read of the name <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> but twice in all the Bible, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.1. and here in <hi>Ezra.</hi> That <hi>Ahaſuerus Daniel</hi> mentions cannot be <hi>Heſters Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuerus,</hi> for that <hi>Ahaſuerus Daniel</hi> tells us was King of the <hi>Medes</hi> only, <hi>Heſters</hi> is King of <hi>Media</hi> and <hi>Perſia</hi> both; <hi>Heſter</hi> 1.3. 2. <hi>Daniels Ahaſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> being Father to that <hi>Darius</hi> who together with <hi>Cyrus</hi> took <hi>Babylon,</hi> could not (becauſe the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Monarchy was ſtanding in his days, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing a great part of thoſe Countries) have his Monarchy extended from <hi>India</hi> even to <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> over one hundred twenty ſeven Provinces, which <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> who married <hi>Heſter</hi> had, Ch. 1.1. In all likelihood therefore (we reading of no other of that name) this <hi>Ahaſuerns Artaxerxes, Ezra</hi> mentions, is the very ſame with him we read of in <hi>Hester.</hi> And indeed the Apccryphal Book of <hi>Heſter</hi> (which although I credit not as Scripture, yet may the ſame credit be given to it as to other Hiſtories) calls him by no other name then <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> who in <hi>Hester</hi> is called <hi>Ahaſuerus;</hi> ſo that it ſeems either name was given to him, and becauſe of that (he being known to ſome by the one, to ſome by the other) doth <hi>Ezra</hi> give him
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:115824:143"/>both, firſt calling him <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> then <hi>Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>If it be ſaid, <hi>But if this</hi> Artaxerxes <hi>were</hi> Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuerus <hi>in</hi> Heſter, <hi>one would think</hi> Heſter <hi>having ſuch influence upon him, and</hi> Mordecai <hi>ſuch power under him, it ſhould have cauſed that the work of the Temple ſhould have gone on again?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not ſo, for the Decree to hinder the Work of the Temple was made, as the Text ſaith, in the beginning of his reign, which was before that <hi>Heſter</hi> was married to him. Now a Decree once made, <hi>Heſter</hi> (as appears in the buſineſſe of <hi>Haman</hi>) was not forward to move the King to alter his Decree; yea, put caſe ſhe had, yet was it a cuſtom amongſt the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> not to repeal any Law, whilſt the King that made it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and therefore <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> though <hi>Heſter</hi> beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it on her knees, could not repeal the Decree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> only by another Decree gives them liberty to ſtand up in their own defence, and make reſiſtance againſt thoſe that ſhould ſeek their lives. So that I ſay the Law once made, it was not an eaſie thing, though <hi>Heſter</hi> was greatly in the Kings favour, and <hi>Mordecai</hi> in great power, to repeal it, whilſt <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> lived, but for his life the work is, and muſt be at a ſtand, though <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> after him (which is an argument that this cuſtom of making irrepealable Laws was binding only to that King that made them, the term of his own life, but not to his Succeſſor or Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors) did repeal this Statute, and by a contrary Decree ſet the work on foot again.</p>
                           <p>Now it being ſo, that in all likelihood that
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:115824:144"/>
                              <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> Husband to <hi>Heſter</hi> is the ſame here meant that hindered the work of the Temple, then, as both the former opinions (which carry not half the probability this doth) concerning <hi>Cambyſes</hi> and <hi>Smerdis</hi> are diſproved; who both put together (and allowing them whatſoever is in any Hiſtory given to them for the time of their reign) did not reign ſo many years as we have in Scripture recorded touching this <hi>Artaxerxes:</hi> ſo it is evident that <hi>Darius Hyſtaſpes</hi> could not bee that <hi>Darius</hi> that gave life again to the Temple-work; for he ſucceeded in the Monarchy (as all affirm) within one year after the death of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſes, Cyrus</hi> Son, and next Succeſſor; but now, betwixt <hi>Cyrus</hi> and that <hi>Darius,</hi> did reign, and that for many years, one <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> or <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> by whom the work was obſtructed.</p>
                           <p>If any yet further curiouſly enquire, which of thoſe Kings named by the <hi>Greeks</hi> this <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> ſhould be, ſeeing they give to none of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchs that name;</p>
                           <p>I anſwer; I ſuppoſe him to be <hi>Darius Hyſtaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes</hi> himſelf, and amongſt other Reaſons might be named, this is one, The activeneſs of <hi>Mordecai</hi> in his Court; now <hi>Mordecai</hi> being one of thoſe carried Captive in the days of <hi>Jeconiah,</hi> Heſter 2.5, 6. which was at the beginning of the ſeventy years, the age of <hi>Mordecai,</hi> in caſe we fix upon any of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchs on this ſide <hi>Hyſtaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes,</hi> will be ſuch as will hardly agree with the ſtory of him and his activity; and this being ſo, the ſuppoſed helper of the Temple-work, is the ſeal hinderer of it.</p>
                           <pb n="259" facs="tcp:115824:144"/>
                           <p>The Concluſion is, <hi>That that</hi> Darius <hi>who after</hi> Cyrus <hi>ſet the Temple-work on foot, cannot be</hi> Darius <hi>Hystaſpes.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Another opinion there is, which will have this <hi>Darius</hi> to be <hi>Darius Nothus;</hi> but to this cannot I ſubſcribe, partly for what I have already ſaid in anſwer to Maſter <hi>Medes</hi> beginning of the ſeventy weeks, who there maintains this opinion; and further, for what I ſaid but even now, in my anſwer to Doctor <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> That <hi>Ezra</hi> upon his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> found that generation who had been builders of the Temple, and the next gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to theſe, extinct, and in their Graves, and a third generation ſurviving. Now <hi>Darius No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi> reigning but nineteen years, we can hardly think (<hi>Artaxerxes</hi> being next Succeſſor to him) that by the ſeventh of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> when <hi>Ezra</hi> went up to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which accounting from the ſixth of <hi>Darius,</hi> when the work of the Temple was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed (at which time <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and the reſt were alive) amounts but to one and twenty years; that I ſay in one and twenty years ſpace (though it is granted many might) yet that a whole gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſhould be gone, and the generation after them, and a third generation come in place, ſeems very ſtrange.</p>
                           <p>Darius Nothus <hi>therefore was not that</hi> Darius <hi>which did advance the building of the Temple.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Queſt. <hi>But what</hi> Darius <hi>are we then to fix upon?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſ. Darius Longimanus,</hi> called moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus,</hi> who was Son to <hi>Xerxes</hi> the Great, and Father to <hi>Darius Nothus.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <pb n="260" facs="tcp:115824:145"/>
                           <p>Now the reaſon why I fix here, is, becauſe this fixation agrees well to the ſtory of things on both ſides, in reſpect of time more eſpecially.</p>
                           <p n="1">1 For the ſucceeding part of the ſtory, that which follows betwixt the finiſhing the Temple-work, and the building <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> it will well ſuit with it; for this <hi>Darius</hi> reigning forty years, (which long reign above other his Predeceſſors I conceive was the fruit of Gods Peoples prayers, which <hi>Darius</hi> makes one reaſon of his Decree for carrying on the work of the Temple, that the <hi>Iews</hi> might offer Sacrifice, and pray for his life, <hi>Ezra</hi> 6.11.) I ſay, he reigning forty years; if we begin from the ſixth year of his reign when the Temple-work was finiſhed, and adding to the thirty four years, the remainder of his reign after the Temple was built, the nineteen years of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Nothus</hi> his Succeſſor, and the ſeven years of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> who ſucceeded him, at which time <hi>Ezra</hi> went up to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> the whole amounts to ſixty years; and if we alſo take in the thirteen years after, when <hi>Nehemiah</hi> went up, it advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the number to ſeventy three: now that in the ſpace of about ſeventy years there ſhould be ſuch a change of Governours and People, the old dead and gone, new come in their room, is no ſtrange thing to conceive. This opinion therefore well ſuits the ſucceeding part of the ſtory.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 For the fore-going part, it ſuits it much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then any of the other opinions. For, thoſe that fix upon <hi>Darius Hyſtaſpes,</hi> cannot (as I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) finde an <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> between him and <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that was a hinderer to the work, which yet that
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:115824:145"/>ſuch a one was, is evident from the ſtory. Thoſe that fix upon <hi>Nothus</hi> make the time ſo wide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the laying the foundation of the Temple, and the finiſhing the work, as can hardly be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined; neither of theſe opinions therefore will ſuit with that part of the Divine Story, which precedes the building of the Temple. But ours, which fixeth upon <hi>Longimanus,</hi> wil ſuit it very wel; for firſt, The block that lies in the way of the firſt of the two former opinions, is by it removed, we having already found an <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> that was a hinderer, and alſo a Predeceſſor to this <hi>Longima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> Secondly, The block that lies in the way of the ſecond, in regard of the length of the time, is hereby well removed, our opinion cutting the time betwixt the laying the Temples foundation, and the finiſhing the work, ſhorter by full forty years then that opinion doth.</p>
                           <p>Obj. <hi>But yet it may be ſaid, That even accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our opinion, the time betwixt</hi> Cyrus <hi>firſt, and</hi> Darius <hi>ſecond year will ſeem too long, for walking by our own rule laid down in our Key,</hi> Theſ. 45.48. <hi>the time amounts to ſeventy years, thus;</hi>

                              <hi>The current year,</hi> viz. <hi>the ſecond of</hi> Longima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, <hi>I take into the number, becauſe it is very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it was not till towards the end of that year that</hi> Darius <hi>Decree came forth, for the</hi> Jews <hi>fall not to the work till the latter end of the ſixth month,</hi> Hag. 1.14,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:115824:146"/>14, 15. <hi>and it was ſome time after that</hi> (<hi>as</hi> Ezraes <hi>Story makes appear) that the Decree came forth; which may therefore poſsibly, and moſt likely, if we throughly weigh the whole of</hi> Zecharies <hi>Viſion, be in that eleventh Month he mentions,</hi> Zec. 1.7. <hi>and being ſo, but a month and a few days are wanting of a compleat year, which little want, where the account is by years, is never reckoned.) Now hence the Objection riſeth; If ſeventy years be alotted to this time (which our opinion grants) then muſt the age of ſome perſons,</hi> viz. <hi>thoſe who had ſeen</hi> Solomons <hi>Temple, and were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live at this day, as</hi> Hag. 2.2, 3. <hi>be no leſſe then one hundred and thirty years; for ſuppoſe them to be ſixty years old in</hi> Cyrus firſt; <hi>to which ſixty, adding theſe ſeventy, we have the aforeſaid number; which age ſeems to be too great for the generations ſince</hi> Moſes <hi>his time.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not ſo; for we finde <hi>Jehoſada</hi> the High Prieſt (who was not long before the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity) to have lived as long, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.15. and alſo (as is teſtified in the firſt Book of <hi>Macca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees</hi>) <hi>Mattathias</hi> the Prieſt, Father to <hi>Judas Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabeus</hi> lived one hundred forty ſix years, Chap. 2. verſe laſt. Indeed the age might ſeem too great, ſhould we (as do ſome) ſix upon <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> ſo taking in forty years more; but here it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, forty years is cut off, which in a mans age is no little matter.</p>
                           <p>Again, Obſerve, that this age was not the age of <hi>Zerubbabel, Jeſhua,</hi> and that generation that came out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but the age of thoſe who were carried into <hi>Babylon</hi> by <hi>Nebucadnezzar,</hi> and ſo indeed were of the generation before <hi>Zerubba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi>
                              <pb n="263" facs="tcp:115824:146"/>and the multitude that came up with him, though yet ſome of them were living at this day.</p>
                           <p>Obj. 2. <hi>I have met with it objected, That the time from</hi> Cyrus <hi>firſt, to the end of</hi> Darius <hi>ſecond, could not be very long, becauſe no Prieſt was by the Law to officiate above twenty years; from thirty years old to fifty was their limited time,</hi> Numb. 4. verſ. 2, 3, 22, 23, 30, 35, 30, <hi>&amp;c. now</hi> Jeſhua <hi>was High Prieſt in</hi> Cyrus <hi>firſt, and ſo likewiſe in</hi> Darius <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the diſtance therefore could not be great, no not twenty years.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſ.</hi> This Law was not a Law for the High Prieſt, but only for the inferiour Prieſts, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, as is clear;</p>
                           <p n="1">1 Becauſe whereſoever it is ſpoken of, Levites only are mentioned, as being ſubject to it.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 Becauſe the work it ſelf, that at fifty years of age they were exempted from, was ſervile work, work that was a burden, as the bearing about of the Tabernacle, verſ. 24, 25, 26. which work too they were to be appointed unto by the High Prieſt, as their Maſter and Lord, as verſ. 19, 27. therefore did not this work, and ſo not this Law, belong to him.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 I finde particular inſtances of High Prieſts that did officiate when they were above fifty years old; what ſhall we ſay to <hi>Eli?</hi> was not <hi>Eli</hi> High Prieſt when upwards of fifty, conſidering he was ninety eight years old when he died, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.15. and yet <hi>Samuel</hi> (who it is evident was born in the time of <hi>Elies</hi> Prieſthood) but a childe even then when <hi>Eli</hi> was very old, and his eyes dim, as is
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:115824:147"/>clear, chap. 2. compare verſ. 18, 19. with ver. 22. and chap. 3. verſ. 2. compare with verſ. 8.</p>
                           <p>But the inſtance of <hi>Iehojada</hi> is undeniable; for obſerve, he creates <hi>Ioaſh</hi> King, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. <hi>Ioaſh</hi> reigns forty years, chap. 24.1. <hi>Iehoſada</hi> dies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Ioaſh,</hi> ver. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>Iehoſada</hi> is one hundred and thirty years old when he dieth, ver. 15. if therefore <hi>Iehojada</hi> died in <hi>Ioaſh</hi> his fortieth year, yet conſidering that he crowned <hi>Ioaſh</hi> King, and that in the time of his Prieſthood, and died not till he was aged one hundred and thirty years, it will neceſſarily follow that he was High Prieſt at ninety years old. This Law therefore was not a Law for the High Prieſt, but only for the Levites; they ceaſed to officiate at fifty years of age, but the High Prieſt was ſuch during life; and indeed he could not otherwiſe have been a fit Type of Chriſt, who ever liveth to make interceſſion for us.</p>
                           <p>This Objection, becauſe I have met with it, I thought good to anſwer, though otherwiſe I ſhould never have objected it to my ſelf.</p>
                           <p>I know nothing elſe can be ſaid for a ſhorter time, unleſſe we ſhould here again bring up thoſe forty ſix years, <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.20. with <hi>Daniels</hi> ſeven weeks, chap. 9.25. both which I have anſwered before in traverſing the ſeventy weeks.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>The time therefore from the beginning of</hi> Cyrus <hi>first, unto the end of</hi> Darius <hi>ſecond, may well bee reckoned ſeventy years, notwithſtanding the weight of any objection againſt it.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But to come nearer; what if we may finde in Scripture this time to be meted and meaſured ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:115824:147"/>years? If the Scripture meaſure agree to the meaſure of the ancient <hi>Greeks,</hi> it will adde credit to their reports in more things then this one.</p>
                           <p>Let us here take into conſideration <hi>Zecharies</hi> ſeventy years, Chap. 1.12. chap. 7.5. this ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me to be their proper place.</p>
                           <p>That theſe ſeventy years ſhould be underſtood of the ſeventy years of the Captivity, cannot be, becauſe (as Doctor <hi>Lightfoot</hi> hath well obſerved in his Chronicle upon <hi>Heſter</hi> ten) the ſeventy years of the Captivity, beginning with the fourth of <hi>Jehojakim,</hi> did end long before this time, viz. with the third of <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> or the laſt year of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy; but the ſeventy years <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi> ſpeaks of, bring us to the ſecond of <hi>Darius,</hi> which is many years upwards in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</p>
                           <p>Doctor <hi>Lightfoots</hi> own account will not neither help the buſineſs; for as he hath nothing but thoſe former ſuppoſitions (which having been put into the ballance were found too light) to maintain that conception, viz. <hi>That that</hi> Darius <hi>who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced the work of the Temple, did reign at ſuch a diſtance from</hi> Cyrus; ſo if theſe two things bee throughly ſcanned,</p>
                           <p n="1">1 What <hi>Darius</hi> it was who ſet this work on foot.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 At what diſtance from <hi>Cyrus</hi> (I ſpeak now of time in the general only) the compelling cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the ſtory, each duly weighed and laid together, will neceſſarily infer him to have lived, (both which my former diſcourſe will
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:115824:148"/>give ſome light into) it will then appear, That Doctor <hi>Lightfoot</hi> himſelf hath exceeded the bounds of ſeventy years, as many years as hee chargeth upon the fore-going reckoning, account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it worthy, for that reaſon only, to be caſt out; by his own rule therefore, his own muſt go out with it.</p>
                           <p>What will thoſe Opinions make of theſe ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years, that will have the finiſhing of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-work to ſtand at forty ſix years diſtance from <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as ſome; or elſe at one hundred and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or one hundred and thirteen years, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; ſeeing it is moſt evident that the complaint the Angel makes of ſeventy years ſufferings was in the ſecond of <hi>Darius,</hi> Zech. 1.7. compared with ver. 12. which was but four years before the work was finiſhed, as appears from <hi>Ezra</hi> 6.15. May theſe allow the ſeventy years to be the years of the Captivity? if ſo, there had need be ſome good reaſon ſhewn for it, why the Holy Ghoſt, after the ſeventy years of the Captivity were ended, and forty and odde years more run out (as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows upon the one opinion) or upwards of an hundred years more, (as it follows upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) ſhould ſpeak ſtill of ſeventy years.</p>
                           <p>For my own part, I think <hi>theſe ſeventy years are to be reckoned from the firſt of</hi> Cyrus, <hi>from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of which year untill the end of</hi> Darius <hi>ſecond,</hi> (at which time the Angel makes this complaint, and therefore the time of the complaint is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly noted to be in the eleventh Month, upon the twenty fourth day of the Month, in the ſecond year of <hi>Darius,</hi> which was the very cloſe of the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:115824:148"/>year, only one Month and a few days wanting) <hi>are reckoned by the</hi> Greek <hi>Hiſtorians exactly ſeventy years, as I have before obſerved, and ſo indeed theſe ſeventy years are not the ſeventy years of the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, but another ſeventy, taking beginning where they end?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Obj. <hi>But if ſo, why doth the Angel plead Gods having had indignation againſt his people threeſcore and ten years? he might have pleaded twice threeſcore and ten years.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſ.</hi> We muſt conſider the Angel here ſpoken of (which is Jeſus Chriſt) now ſpeaks by way of complaint, <hi>How long, Lord wilt thou not have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> — and therefore he purpoſely lets fall the firſt ſeventy years, taking no notice of them, becauſe as to that time he had no cauſe to complain, they had deſerved it highly, provoked his Father, for which cauſe <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was juſtly made a rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous heap: It was the penalty of that Law, or outward Covenant made with this people at the coming out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that in caſe they did rebel they ſhould be carried captive into other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries out of their own Land, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. verſe. 27, 28. to the end; and obſerve, this was the higheſt puniſhment of all, inflicted for higheſt breach of the Law, therefore mentioned in the laſt place. Now all the ſeventy years of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity they were under this very puniſhment, therefore the thing being moſt righteous, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a thing unavoydable, if God would be juſt, conſidering the terms of the Covenant this people ſtood under, Chriſt (who pleadeth righteouſly) will not complain of it, leſt he ſhould complain of
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:115824:149"/>his Father for doing that which was moſt righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and which he could not without breach of Juſtice have omitted. But now as to the time that paſſed afterwards, he had cauſe to complain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all this time was over and above the prefix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time of their puniſhment, and therefore hee complains, <hi>Lord how long wilt thou not have mercy on</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and on the Cities of</hi> Judah, <hi>againſt which thou haſt had indignation theſe threeſcore and ten years?</hi> as to ſay, Theſe ſeventy years of thy indignation are more then ſhould be; and that Chriſt ſpeaks by way of complaint is clear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is fain to give him good words to ſtill him, and tell him the work ſhould be deferred no longer, verſ. 13, 14, 16, 17. an Argument that he had ſome cauſe to complain, and that upon this account, the work had been deferred, and that for ſo long a time as ſeventy years. So that this Text, rightly conſidered, is an Argument for us, and holds forth thus much, That we are not to begin theſe ſeventy years till the ſeventy of the Captivity were ended; for Chriſt complains of the wrath of his Father to his people all theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty years; but as to the ſeventy years of the Captivity, which was only ſatisfaction to that outward Covenant they had broken, Chriſt had no cauſe to complain of one day of that, nor would he, the puniſhment being moſt juſt, and the Covenant broken, and no puniſhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted had been unjuſt.</p>
                           <p>Obj. 2. <hi>But if this opinion be true, why alſo are the Faſts of the fourth, and the fifth, and the ſeventh, and the tenth Month ſaid to be of ſeventy years conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance,</hi>
                              <pb n="269" facs="tcp:115824:149"/>Zach. 7.5. <hi>with Chap.</hi> 8.19. <hi>ſeeing from the time</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>was taken, the Temple deſtroyed, &amp;c. which things are the grounds of their faſting, it was now to this time (as we account it) one hundred and twenty years, viz. fifty in</hi> Babylon <hi>after</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem <hi>and the Temple were deſtroyed, and ſeventy after the coming thence?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſ.</hi> The only foot that this Objection ſtands upon, is a ſuppoſition that the aforeſaid Faſts were kept in <hi>Babylon;</hi> Now as to that I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
                           <p n="1">1 That there is no Scripture proving ſuch a thing. That, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137.1, 2. will not do it, for it is one thing to weep occaſionally, (which is the weeping there mentioned, Gods people ſit down by the Rivers of <hi>Babylon,</hi> one while they call <hi>Sion</hi> to remembrance, another while they are ſcoffed at by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> theſe things draw forth oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional tears) but it is another to weep in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Aſſembly, and as a ſolemn Ordinance, which calls upon me to weep and mourn, and that at ſuch a time. Now ſuch was the weeping of the fourth, and fifth, and ſeventh, and tenth Months, which were times of weeping and mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, inſtituted and ordained by the publick au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, to be celebrated year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though by the way remember, that their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in this is not a binding rule to us in Goſpel days; National inſtitutions in Spiritual matters ceaſing with their National Church.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 As there is no Scripture for it, that theſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Faſts were kept in <hi>Babylon;</hi> ſo look upon the thing in reaſon, and it ſeems no way likely or
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:115824:150"/>probable; for conſider, the Faſts were Publique and National, kept not by ſome particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but by the whole Body of the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as appears, Chap. 7. ver. 5, 6. Now it may with good reaſon be queried, Whether it be a thing at all probable, that the <hi>Babylonians</hi> would admit of ſuch exerciſes under their very Noſes?</p>
                           <p>Obj. <hi>If it be ſaid, Though the thing were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, as to the</hi> Jews, <hi>that is, the whole Body of that Nation in</hi> Babylon <hi>did Faſt, yet might they ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point their meetings, as that the thing might well be kept from the knowledge of the</hi> Babylonians?</p>
                           <p>I anſwer; Conſider, that as theſe Faſts were Publique, ſo alſo they were ſet Faſts, appointed to ſeveral times, and theſe celebrated annually, year after year, and that for a long time, ſeventy years; all which things laid together, we cannot imagine that the celebration of ſo many days, for ſo many years together, ſhould, or could be a thing ſo private as to be hid from the <hi>Babylonians;</hi> if it were known, then I ſay muſt they be kept with their allowance. Now conſidering <hi>Babylon</hi> the place, Satans buſie rage to ſtir up his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt any Spiritual work, the <hi>Babylonians</hi> themſelves being Idolaters, and Worſhippers of a falſe god, withall the occaſions of theſe ſolemn meetings, whereof that of the fourth Month was in memorial of <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> taking <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> which fell out in this Month, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 25.3, 4. <hi>Jer.</hi> 39.2, 3. That of the fifth, for the burning of the Temple, which was done the tenth day of this Month, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 25.8, 9. <hi>Jer.</hi> 52.12, 13.
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:115824:150"/>That of the ſeventh Month for the death of <hi>Geda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah,</hi> which hapned in this Month, and was the cauſe of the total diſperſing of the remnant left in <hi>Judea,</hi> Ier. 41.1, &amp;c. That of the tenth, for <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzars</hi> ſiege which was laid againſt <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> in the tenth day of this Month, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 25.1. <hi>Jer.</hi> 52.4. All which occaſions of theſe ſolemn Aſſemblies (that of the ſeventh Month excepted) was ſuch as might ſuggeſt to the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> that this people aſſembled together yearly to lament their good ſucceſſe and proſperity. Let us lay all together, and where we want a determinate rule, conjecture, whether (the premiſes conſidered) it be a thing likely that the <hi>Babylonians</hi> would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſuch conſtant yearly Exerciſes in <hi>Babylon</hi> or no?</p>
                           <p>I am therefore inclined to think, That the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and celebration of theſe Publique ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Faſts, was not in <hi>Babylon,</hi> but upon their coming thence; after the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty given them by <hi>Cyrus</hi> to return from <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and were come up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> with their hearts greatly raiſed through the preſent ſenſe of their deliverance, and alſo with expectations of ſomething more then ordinary, that God would now do for them; and having no ſooner ſet hand to the work, but are ſtopped, contrary to expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they are now put upon looking backwards, to ſee what might be the cauſe God ſhould deal thus with them. And to this, their hearts being now melted, and affected under the preſent ſenſe of their deliverance, they are in a frame and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture much better then while they remained in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi>
                              <pb n="272" facs="tcp:115824:151"/>under a Cloud, and a ſenſe of wrath, which we know ever unfits, and makes a Soul uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of looking back upon former ways and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Now looking backwards they finde, That they had received ſuch and ſuch heavy ſtroaks from God formerly, which ſtroaks fell upon the whole Body of the Nation, yet had they never as yet in any ſolemn way humbled themſelves before God for thoſe their ſins and provocations, which brought theſe ſtroaks upon them: Hereupon they appoint ſeveral days of Humiliation to bee kept yearly, till the anger of the Lord ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; and the better to ſtir up their hearts, (through a putting them in remembrance by the ſtroak) they appoint their days upon ſuch and ſuch times as the ſtroaks, which did prove moſt fatal to them, fel upon them, which is all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be given of the appointment of the Faſts in ſuch and ſuch Months, as is before ſpecified.</p>
                           <p>And therefore obſerve, in the fourth of <hi>Darius,</hi> in the ninth Month, when now the people of God perceiving the ſtorm to be well blown over, the Temple-work being now on foot again, and brought to ſome perfection, do ſend men, as <hi>Sherezer, Regemmelech,</hi> &amp;c. to enquire whether they ſhould any longer (it ſeeming that God was now pacified) go on with that faſting which they had continued for ſeventy years; the anſwer is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Prophet to the Congregation there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and the People that were in the Land, ver. 4.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. and not to thoſe in <hi>Babylon,</hi> of whom not one ſyllable is ſpoken. A clear Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that <hi>Sherezer, Regemmelech,</hi> &amp;c. were not
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:115824:151"/>ſent by the people in <hi>Babylon,</hi> (as ſaith the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall opinion) but were indeed employed, being two Honourable perſons, by the whole Body of the People now in the Land, to go up to the Houſe of the Lord, and enquire for them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this practice they had ſo long continued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; Whether Gods wrath ſeeming now to be pacified, they ſhould continue it any longer. Anſwer hereupon by the Prophet is given to the people of the Land, proving clearly, that this Faſt was not a Faſt in <hi>Babylon,</hi> but a Faſt that had been kept up and continued by the people of the Land, which (as I have ſaid) began upon their coming thither, and the cauſe till this day remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, had been continued by them ever ſince; through which long continuance of time it was even now grown into a form, therefore God by the Prophet ſeems at firſt to diſown it, Chap. 7.5, 6. and yet afterwards (as being a thing lawfull and good in its firſt inſtitution, though through continuance of time abuſed by them) he ownes it, Chap. 8.19. So that this text rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, is ſo farre from hurting us, that contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it brings with it a ſecond teſtimony to prove the truth of our Aſſertion, that it was ſeventy years betwixt <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and the <hi>Darius</hi> that forwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Temple-work.</p>
                           <p>If any ſhould yet think our meaſure to be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applied, and that ſurely it could not be ſo long as ſeventy years from the return of the Captivity to the end of <hi>Darius</hi> ſecond, I ſhall adde one conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration more, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Iddo,</hi> who was Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father to the Prophet <hi>Zechary,</hi> as appears <hi>Zech.</hi>
                              <pb n="274" facs="tcp:115824:152"/>1.1. was one of them that came up with <hi>Zerub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel,</hi> as we ſhall finde, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 12.4. which <hi>Iddo Nehemiah</hi> ſpeaks of, that it was the ſame perſon, and not another of the ſame name appears, in that we finde <hi>Zechariah,</hi> (and that in the daies of <hi>Jojakim</hi> ſonne of <hi>Jeſhua,</hi> which well agrees to the latter times of <hi>Zechariahs</hi> Prophecy) mentioned by name, as ſucceeding in the line of <hi>Iddo,</hi> ver. 16. and though <hi>Zechariah</hi> is there recorded amongſt the chief of the Prieſts, yet doth not that hinder but it ſhould be this very <hi>Zechariah,</hi> ſeeing moſt ordinarily Prophets were taken from amongſt the Prieſts; <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was of the Prieſts of <hi>Anathoth,</hi> and yet a Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was a Prieſt, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.3. and yet a Prophet. All therefore that can be gathered thence is, That <hi>Zechariah</hi> as hee was a Prophet, ſo alſo he was one of the chief of the Prieſts.</p>
                           <p>Now <hi>Zechariah</hi> who mentions theſe ſeventy years, being Grand-childe to one that came up with <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> it may very well bee thought, that betwixt theſe two, as much time as ſeventy years may be allowed, and yet no monſtrous Concluſion.</p>
                           <p>From the whole it appears, <hi>That to fix the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the Temple-work upon the ſecond year of</hi> Darius Longimanus, <hi>doth not at all jarre, but rather hath an admirable concurrency, ſo as no opinion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it, with what ſeems to be moſt clear in Scripture, as touching the time betwixt</hi> Cyrus <hi>firſt year, and</hi> Darius <hi>ſecond.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Withall (though I would not be over-curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, for I hate over-much niceneſs and curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:115824:152"/>in Notions, as well as in Words, yet let mee ſay) hereby we gain this, to run the time betwixt the beginning of the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity, and Chriſts Paſſion, all along upon ſeventies; (the Number ſo famous for ſetting forth this time.)</p>
                           <p>Firſt, We have Seventy years Captivity in <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Secondly, Seventy years of mourning in the Land after their return thence, before the Work of the Temple can go on.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, After that we have Seventy years, and ſeven odde, (obſerve, though we have ſome odde, yet they run ſtill upon the Number ſeven) before the <hi>Jews</hi> can have liberty to build their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and form themſelves into a Common-wealth; for ſo many years paſſed betwixt <hi>Darius</hi> ſecond, and the time of <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> Commiſſion.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, We have Seventy Weeks, which makes ſeven ſeventies, from the building <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to the Paſſion of Chriſt.</p>
                           <p>In a word, from the beginning of the Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, untill Chriſts Paſſion, we have ten Seventies, and three odde years; for though I mentioned even now ſeven odde years, yet it muſt bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, that four years out of that ſeven are to be deducted, to ſupply the want of thoſe four years, which I have before proved are to be cut off from the ſeventeeth and laſt of <hi>Daniels</hi> weeks; theſe deducted, there then remains three odde only. Now allowing theſe three to the time Chriſt Preached, which was three years, we may then ſay, That from the beginning of the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> loſt their Kingdome, to
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:115824:153"/>the annoynting of the Meſſiah, or the firſt viſible appearance of Chriſt their King, was exactly ten times ſeventy years, which maketh ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, running ſtill upon the Number ſeven, both in the tens and hundreds. Within which time <hi>Matthew</hi> makes mention of fourteen Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to have lived, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.17. Note, That they muſt make ſhort Generations, that begin the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty weeks with the firſt of <hi>Cyrus.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Seeing therefore that to pitch upon <hi>Darius Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimanus,</hi> as he that in his ſecond year ſet on foot the work of the Temple, doth better then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opinion agree to the Divine Story, and other Scriptures, as to the time and things fore-going and ſucceeding the Temple-building, I do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conclude, <hi>That that</hi> Darius, <hi>whom the</hi> Greeks <hi>call</hi> Longimanus, <hi>was the</hi> Darius <hi>under whom the Temple-work was finiſhed.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Another Queſtion now will ariſe, (which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, we come to our main Concluſion driven at throughout this Section) viz. <hi>What</hi> Artaxerxes <hi>was that which ſucceeded</hi> Darius Longimanus? <hi>for (as I ſaid at firſt) the</hi> Artaxerxes <hi>we are now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring after muſt needs be, by the clear circumſtances of the text, ſuch a one as did ſucceed that</hi> Darius, <hi>which gave life to the building of the Temple.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now this is confeſſed on all hands to be that <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> whom the <hi>Greeks</hi> call <hi>Mnemon,</hi> who was next Succeſſor to <hi>Longimanus</hi> his next, <hi>Darius Nothus</hi> ſucceeding <hi>Longimanus,</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes Mnemon, Darius Nothus.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was he that firſt gave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to <hi>Ezra,</hi> in the ſeventh year of his reign, to
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:115824:153"/>go up to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> furniſhing him largely with Monies, and afterwards to <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> in the twentieth of his reign, to build <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> which friendlineſs of his to Gods Cauſe and people went not unrewarded, for he reigned forty three years.</p>
                           <p>And which I cannot but mention to ſet it before Rulers, of all the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchs, <hi>Longimanus</hi> and <hi>Mnemon,</hi> who had been of the moſt forward in favouring the People of God, and promoting his Cauſe, were bleſſed of God with length of days beyond any their Predeceſſors, or Succeſſors in the Empire.</p>
                           <p>And which is another thing moſt obſervable, that by looking over theſe Hiſtories mine eye hath been caſt upon, viz. <hi>That ſo long as any of the Race of</hi> Cyrus (who firſt appeared to own the Cauſe of God) <hi>did continue, ſo long did the</hi> Perſian <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy ſtand; but under the very firſt King that was of another Race, viz.</hi> Darius Codomannus, <hi>or</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius <hi>the laſt, who was</hi> (as is affirmed) <hi>a ſtranger to the bloud of</hi> Cyrus, <hi>the whole Monarchy is loſt, and tranſlated from the</hi> Medes <hi>and</hi> Perſians <hi>to the</hi> Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians; So mindful was God of what <hi>Cyrus</hi> did for his people, that whilſt any of his Seed remained, he would not give the Kingdom to another.</p>
                           <p>Now, beſides what hath been ſaid already from the ſcope of our Diſcourſe ſince I entred this Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is a thing moſt evident, <hi>that that</hi> Artaxerxes <hi>from whom</hi> Nehemiah <hi>received his Commiſsion, was, yea can be no other than,</hi> Artaxerxes Mnemon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe two things are clear in Scripture concerning this <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> which can be applied to no other but <hi>Mnemon;</hi> as,</p>
                           <pb n="278" facs="tcp:115824:154"/>
                           <p n="1">1 That <hi>he reigned many years,</hi> two and thirty <hi>Nehemiah</hi> mentions, Chap. 13.6.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 That <hi>the time of his reign was towards the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of the</hi> Perſian <hi>Monarchy,</hi> which is clear hence, becauſe <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> who lived all the time of this <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> did afterwards live to ſee that Generation in which the Monarchy was tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: for he makes particular mention of <hi>Iaddus</hi> the High Prieſt, who met <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great at his coming to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and of that <hi>Darius</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whom the Monarchy was loſt, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 12.11.22. which clearly proves this <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> muſt be <hi>Mnemen,</hi> none of the Monarchs after him reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo long, as the Scripture it ſelf records him to have done.</p>
                           <p>Ere I can yet reach our Concluſion, there is one knob in the way to be even'd.</p>
                           <p>Obj. <hi>If</hi> Artaxerxes Mnemon <hi>be the</hi> Artaxerxes <hi>we are to ſix upon, from the twentieth of whoſe reign</hi> Daniels <hi>ſeventy weeks are to be begun, then conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring they end with Christs Paſsion,</hi> Daniels <hi>account will ſuperabound the account of all Hiſtorians, who finde not ſo many years as four hundred and ninety betwixt the one time and the other.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. There are not ſo many over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove in this account, but there are full as many wanting in their account, who begin <hi>Daniels</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty weeks with the Decree of <hi>Cyrus;</hi> and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we reckon more or leſs, the matter is one and the ſame; yet is the bone there ſwallowed without pricking, by not a few godly and able men.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 I anſwer; In caſe what I have ſaid as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the beginning and ending of <hi>Daniels</hi> ſeventy
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:115824:154"/>weeks be truth, and it will not accord with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels</hi> Prophecy of the ſeventy weeks, nor with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scriptures, to ſtate any other beginning or ending; then of neceſſity muſt we either condemn the Holy Ghoſt for mentioning more years with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that time then indeed there are, or Hiſtorians of neglect, in not having accounted for ſo many years as they ſhould; and who ſhall we? <hi>Let God be true, but every man a Lyar.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>If it be ſaid, <hi>But why will I depart from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of Human Writers here, when as I made uſe of them before to meaſure another time?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I did not make uſe of them before, as building any faith upon them, but becauſe I finde the account they have kept of the time to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Scripture account; and ſo farre I am bound to beleeve they have kept ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts aright, not becauſe they ſay ſo, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Scripture ſaith ſo; and this I verily think, that there is ſufficient in Scripture to make out this our account, though they (I mean the Heathen Writers) were not; yet withall I am of the minde, that the conſidering what they ſay, and laying it to thoſe things that are left us in the Word, may (through the Spirits guidance) be a help to us in things wherein they are in the right, as to the more ſpeedy finding them, and the more caſie making them out; yet we holding this as a moſt conſtant and infallible rule, <hi>That all their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports muſt be bowed to the Scripture, and not one tittle of Scripture made to bow to them;</hi> Upon this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple therefore, ſuppoſing the Heathen Writers to have computed ſixty or eighty years from <hi>Cyrus</hi>
                              <pb n="280" facs="tcp:115824:155"/>firſt to <hi>Longimanus</hi> ſecond, yet would I reckon ſeventy, and not regard their reports; and alſo upon this Principle, becauſe the Scripture hath ſo clearly determined the beginning and ending of the ſeventy weeks, I judge I am bound to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count as many years betwixt time and time as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> doth, though Human Writers will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it. This Scripture rule once found determines all the different accounts of times that are left us by Human Writers, and declares whether or no any of them be in the truth; and in caſe any are, who they are.</p>
                           <p>But ſecondly, Should we go to the bare Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Man, yet in common reaſon more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit is to be given to what is recorded by the <hi>Greeks</hi> as touching the times of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy, then to what Writers in after times did record, as touching the continuance of the <hi>Graecian,</hi> and the ſucceeding years of the <hi>Roman</hi> until Chriſt. The reaſon is, becauſe the Monarchy of the <hi>Perſians</hi> was more ſtable, and not ſubject to thoſe ſtrange mutations, (toſſing the Ball of the Kingdome from one to another, and back again) which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily cauſe miſtakes in Hiſtorians. But who knows any thing of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchy, knows that it was after <hi>Alexanders</hi> death a very heap of confuſion, through the ſcuffle that aroſe betwixt <hi>Alexanders</hi> Captains, as was the whole World afterwards, when that terrible Beaſt, the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, was riſing; ſo that within this time the beſt of Hiſtorians might miſtake, and loſe many years. If I had not therefore Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to back me, yet this would a little help the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:115824:155"/>cauſe, why I follow the reports of ſome, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject others, becauſe more credit upon a meer ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional account is to be given to thoſe I follow, then to the other from whom I diſſent.</p>
                           <p>From the whole of my Diſcourſe in this Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Concluſion is, <hi>That that</hi> Artaxerxes, <hi>in the twentieth of whoſe reign</hi> Nehemiah <hi>went up to</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, <hi>was</hi> Artaxerxes Mnemon.</p>

                           <p>It being clear from what we have ſaid in the fore-going Section, <hi>That</hi> Artaxerxes Mnemon <hi>was the</hi> Artaxerxes <hi>that gave Commiſsion to</hi> Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah, <hi>in the twentieth year of his reign, to go up to</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem <hi>and build it;</hi> The way now lies open for us to compute the years appertaining to this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, which is the firſt upon account, though in order of handling I have placed it in the cloze of our Diſcourſe, as ſeeming to me to be in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect its proper place.</p>
                           <p>The Queſtion is, What number of years are we to account from <hi>Cyrus</hi> firſt, where begins the two thouſand three hundred days, till <hi>Artaxerxes Mnemons</hi> twentieth (or to ſpeak more properly his one and twentieth) where begins <hi>Daniels</hi> ſeventy weeks?</p>
                           <p>If the Scripture will help us here, then need wee not much regard what Chronologers ſay; but we may without, and though it bee againſt them, conclude the full and certain number of years even from <hi>Cyrus</hi> firſt till Chriſts Paſſion, for as for the time betwixt <hi>Mnemons</hi> twentieth and Chriſts Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:115824:156"/>
                              <hi>Daniels</hi> ſeventy weeks are an infallible rule to meaſure that by; now, if a like Scripture-rule, or a rule equivalent thereunto, whoſe very matter whereof it is made is the Word, may be found to meaſure the time betwixt <hi>Cyrus</hi> firſt, and <hi>Mnemons</hi> twentieth, then have we the meaſure of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary to mete the time from <hi>Cyrus</hi> firſt till our Lords Paſſion; this being the only approved and ſealed meaſure, all other meaſures muſt be ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by it, not it by them.</p>
                           <p>The Account the <hi>Greeks</hi> give us of this time, (which almoſt all Chronologers adhere unto) I have laid down in my <hi>Key,</hi> Theſ. 45, 46, 47. by which reckoning (but three years being allowed to <hi>Cyrus</hi> after his taking <hi>Babylon</hi>) the years are one hundred forty ſeven.</p>
                           <p>The reaſon why I give to <hi>Cyrus</hi> but three years, when the <hi>Greeks</hi> allow him thirty, I have alſo there declared, <hi>Theſ.</hi> 48.</p>
                           <p>Some more perſons then I have there ſpecified did reign in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy betwixt <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes Mnemon,</hi> as betwixt <hi>Cambyſes</hi> and <hi>Darius Hyſtaſpes,</hi> the <hi>Magi</hi> reigned ſeven Months; betwixt <hi>Xerxes</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus, Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus</hi> reigned ſeven Months; betwixt <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus,</hi> and <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> reigned firſt <hi>Xerxes</hi> the ſecond two Months, after him <hi>Sogdia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> ſeven Months. But the time of the reign of theſe, as laid down by Chronologers, doth not at all break ſquares, as to the fore-going number of one hundred forty ſeven years, for the ſeven Months of the <hi>Magi</hi> are reckoned into the laſt year of <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> to whom, together with the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:115824:156"/>
                              <hi>Magi,</hi> eight years is given, but he alone reigned but ſeven years and five months, to which Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologers adde the ſeven months of the <hi>Magi,</hi> ſo giving eight years to <hi>Cambyſes.</hi> So for the reſt, <hi>Artabanus</hi> ſeven months are included in the laſt year of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> whoſe reign with theſe ſeven months added made up but twenty one years. The two months of <hi>Xerxes</hi> the ſecond, and the ſeven of <hi>Sogdianus</hi> are all included in the fortieth and laſt year of <hi>Longimanus,</hi> who with theſe nine months added, reigned forty years.</p>
                           <p>And for this reaſon, becauſe theſe reigned ſo ſhort a time, no one of them filling up a year, and the time of the reign of each being alwaies included in the reign of his Predeceſſor, are the Names of theſe by many left out, and not put into the ordinary Catalogue of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings.</p>
                           <p>But ſhould I lay the bottome of my demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration here, I ſhould depart from my own rule; I am therefore to enquire what Scripture ſaith to our Queſtion, and whether that will allow this number of years, yea or no.</p>
                           <p>As to the Queſtion therefore, firſt in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, let us ſee whether there bee any footing in Scripture for ſo long a time, leaving the ſet num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of years.</p>
                           <p>Now as to this let it only bee minded again which hath been proved already, viz. <hi>That it was Seventy years from the firſt of</hi> Cyrus, <hi>till the time that the Work of the ſecond Temple was again ſet on foot by</hi> Darius; here wee have (the odde ſeven years ſet aſide) the half of the time, now for the other ſeventy ſeven wee have this to ſay (the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:115824:157"/>ground of which hath been alſo laid down before) that <hi>Jeſhua</hi> was High Prieſt in <hi>Darius</hi> ſecond year, <hi>Ezra</hi> 5.1, 2. but now in <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> twentieth, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaſhib</hi> (<hi>Jeſhuaes</hi> Grand-childe) was High Prieſt, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 3.1, 20. who alſo was ſo aged at <hi>Ezraes</hi> coming up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which was thirteen years before <hi>Nehemiahs,</hi> that he had a Son a Prieſt, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.6. time muſt be allowed for this change, and to allow ſeventy ſeven years is no abſurd concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Put the one and the other together, and as many years as one hundred forty ſeven may well be thought to have paſſed, betwixt the time of <hi>Cyrus</hi> Decree, and <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> Commiſſion.</p>
                           <p>But it wil be ſaid, Although it may be conceived that this time was as long, yet is not what hath been ſaid ground ſufficient for a determined time; But now the time we are ſeeking after muſt be a determined time, for a few years more or leſſe puts our whole account out of order.</p>
                           <p>In anſwer hereto, I grant that we have not a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined time of one hundred forty ſeven years upon any particular ſum mentioned in Scripture, but in caſe wee have it upon general Scripture Principles, or the account of any groſſe ſum, and no particular text ſo contradicting, but that the time may be judged as long, the proof is good, and proof of this kind is as firm as any other; for if proof by a groſſe ſum be not admitted, let any (if they can) caſt the time how many years <hi>Iſrael</hi> abode in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and after that how many years it was from <hi>Ioſhuaes</hi> dividing to the twelve Tribes the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> by Lot, untill the time that the Judges began to bear rule; theſe times can be
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:115824:157"/>counted no otherwayes, but only by a groſſe ſumme; if therefore proof by a groſſe ſumme be denied, the very foundation of all Chronology is razed.</p>
                           <p>Now I ſay, though we have not any particular Text that doth aſcertain us that this time was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly a hundred forty and ſeven years, neither more nor leſſe; yet we have it upon general Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture principles, and the account of a groſſe ſumme.</p>
                           <p>My Argument lyes thus, The two thouſand three hundred dayes muſt expire at the ſame point with the one thouſand three hundred thirty five. The truth of this is evident beyond denial, from what hath been already ſaid as touching either Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, that Chap. 8. and the other Chap. 11, 12. which determines, Firſt, that the matter and ſcope of either Propheſie is one and the ſame. Secondly, that either Propheſie hath one and the ſame end, both ſhutting up with the end or final deſtruction of the fourth Monarchy. This being ſo, the two thouſand three hundred dayes, which bring us to the end of one Propheſie; the one thouſand three hundred thirty five, which brings us to the end of the other, muſt neceſſarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire at one and the ſame point.</p>
                           <p>Hence I conclude,</p>
                           <p>That having ſo much of the two thouſand three hundred dayes upon firm and particular ground as will make the two thouſand three hundred dayes to end with the one thouſand three hundred thirty five, ſaving only theſe one hundred forty ſeven years, that therefore becauſe they

And this conſequence is ſo natural and neceſſary, that put caſe the account of the <hi>Greeks</hi> were thrown out of the doors, and all that we have ſaid before in our two former Sections and this, proving that the time may well be judged as long, were yet unſaid, yet in caſe no particular Scripture do neceſſarily prove this time muſt be either ſhorter or longer, I ſay this alone de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines that the years from <hi>Cyrus</hi> firſt, to the time of <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> Commiſſion, muſt be one hundred forty ſeven, not a year more or leſſe.</p>
                           <p>If it be ſaid, But the weight of our Argument lyes upon the beginning of the one thouſand three hundred thirty five dayes; which ſhould another beginning then that which I have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſtated be found for them, our Concluſion is nothing.</p>
                           <p>I anſwer, Whoſoever is not ſatisfied with that beginning we have formerly laid down, but ſeeks another, muſt mind theſe two things; 1 That he ſo ſix the head of the one thouſand three hundred thirty five dayes, as that he make them to expire at the ſame point with the two thouſand three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. 2 That he alſo make the one thouſand two hundred and ninety, (which ariſeth from the ſame Head with the one thouſand three hundred thirty five) to end at the ſame point with the one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred and ſixty. If either of theſe be not done, thoſe manifeſt Scripture-principles,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:115824:159"/>laid down in my <hi>Key, Theſ.</hi> 17. and <hi>Theſ.</hi> 34. are deſtroyed. Now he that ſhall undertake this work, I queſtion not but that after he hath well conſidered all, he will find it a more eaſie thing to beleeve, then prove.</p>
                           <p>But ſecondly, I anſwer, That the beginning of the one thouſand three hundred thirty five dayes with <hi>Julian,</hi> is the only beginning (ſetting the Harmony aſide) that is conſonant to truth. I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue thus, The taking away of the daily ſacrifice, and ſetting up the abomination that maketh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate, which is the Head of this number, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.11, 12. muſt be taken either in a litteral ſenſe, as referring to the people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> or in a ſpiritual, as referring to the Gentile Saints. That the words ſhould here be underſtood in a ſpiritual ſenſe is no way likely to be the mind of <hi>Daniel</hi> in this place, the reaſon is clear, becauſe, the promiſe of a certain time of Deliverance, verſ. 1. which was the very thing that put <hi>Daniel</hi> upon querying, and drew forth theſe anſwers about the time, is made expreſly to the <hi>Jews,</hi> which therefore are twice in that firſt verſe called <hi>Daniels</hi> People. <hi>The Prince that ſtandeth for the children of thy people — at that time ſhall thy people be delivered.</hi> — Although the Gentile-Saints in <hi>Daniel</hi> are called <hi>the holy people, the understanding people, the people that know their God, the Saints of the moſt high, &amp;c.</hi> yet are they never called <hi>thy people;</hi> that is a phraſe peculiar to the <hi>Jews,</hi> as chap. 9.24. chap. 10.14. chap. 11.14. and no where applied to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Now whereas the Holy Ghoſt when hee gives forth that time of deliverance by way of
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:115824:160"/>Promiſe, which afterwards hee meaſures, uſeth this phraſe twice together, <hi>thy people, thy people,</hi> it clearly denotes, that he is ſpeaking of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that the time of deliverance firſt promiſed, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards meaſured, hath a ſpecial relation to that people; ſo as that no deliverance whatſoever from Captivity and Bondage, unleſs it bee a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Natural <hi>Jews,</hi> can be a fulfilling of this place. Seeing therefore that the taking away of the daily Sacrifice in this place muſt bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood literally, we muſt apply it to the time when this was done in part, or in the beginning, or elſe to the time when this work was throughly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. The partial performance hereof was in <hi>Veſpatians</hi> time, when the <hi>Jews</hi> loſing their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in reſpect of the outward building, were put by ſacrifiſing, and could ſacrifiſe no longer, the place in which all their Sacrifices were to be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, being now demoliſhed. This is that Chriſt points at, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.15. and this was, to ſpeak properly, rather a Ceſſation of the daily Sacrifice, then a taking it away.</p>
                           <p>The compleat performance hereof was in <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> time, when the <hi>Jews</hi> loſt their Temple, not only in reſpect of building, but alſo in reſpect of the very being of it, the very foundation being now removed, and the Temple-ground it ſelf loſt by an Earthquake.</p>
                           <p>Now the Queſtion is, <hi>Whether of the two are we to chuſe for our Head to the one thouſand three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thirty five days, whether the demoliſhing of the Temple-building in</hi> Veſpaſians <hi>time, or the utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Temple being, in</hi> Julians?</p>
                           <pb n="289" facs="tcp:115824:160"/>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not the firſt, becauſe the deliverance poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at in the end of this time, being (upon our aforeſaid ground) a deliverance of the people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the event (conſidering that the time from that beginning is expired long ſince) doth neceſſarily prove it falſe. And this Argument from the event is firm and good, conſidering the premiſes, viz. <hi>That the</hi> Jews <hi>are here ſpoken of, and aſſurance given to</hi> Daniel <hi>of their deliverance af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch a time.</hi> If therefore we ſee the time run out, and that many years, and yet no ſuch thing in accompliſhment as the <hi>Jews deliverance,</hi> wee may truly ſay, ſome other beginning muſt bee ſought; for there can be no error in the Word it ſelf, whatſoever may bee in mens interpretations thereof. It neceſſarily therefore follows, (becauſe the words being to be underſtood literally, as pointing to the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> people, and the place of their Worſhip, we have no other beginning) that we ſhould begin with the ſecond, viz. <hi>The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating of this work of Temple-deſolation, which fell out in the time of</hi> Julian. So that to begin the one thouſand three hundred thirty five days with <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> hath more approbation from Scripture (wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our Harmony) than any other opinion.</p>
                           <p>Now the one thouſand three hundred thirty five days being begun there, our former Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for one hundred forty ſeven years betwixt the coming out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> time, will appear good upon the groſs ſum: for, by this allowance, the two thouſand three hundred days wil, without it cannot, end (as yet they muſt) with the one thouſand three hundred thirty five.</p>
                           <pb n="290" facs="tcp:115824:161"/>
                           <p>That the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and moſt Chronologers that follow their accounts, do compute the ſame num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of years from the beginning of <hi>Cyrus</hi> firſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the end of <hi>Artaxerxes Mnemons</hi> twentieth, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be looked upon as an Argument againſt us, but if any thing, it is rather an Argument for us; Let us not, becauſe every man is a Lyar, make the Word of God (which in this caſe ſpeaks enough for us, though men had ſaid nothing) a Lyar too. If the Devil ſhould ſpeak agreeable to this rule, ſo farre there is truth in him; but if Angels ſpeak againſt it, it is becauſe there is no truth in them.</p>
                           <p>Obj. <hi>But</hi> Daniel, <hi>chap.</hi> 11.1, 2. <hi>reckons but four Kings, after</hi> Cyrus, <hi>to have reigned in the whole</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian <hi>Monarchy, untill the time that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy was tranſlated to the</hi> Greeks. <hi>And if ſo, then may not this time, which contains not the whole, but a part of the time of that Monarchy, be counted ſo long as one hundred forty ſeven years.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſ.</hi> Should I grant the thing, yet is it not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible; for if but four reigned, if we allow to the reign of each fifty years (which is no thing miraculous) the three firſt alone will exceed our time, and the others reign added will go as farre as any conceive the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy did laſt. They that urge this, muſt prove from Scripture, that theſe did not reign ſo long, or they do nothing againſt our former Arguments, which do ſtrongly infer, (till the contrary be proved) that if betwixt <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> but four did reign, they muſt reign ſo long.</p>
                           <p>But ſecondly, I do not grant the thing, nor ſee
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:115824:161"/>the leaſt ſhew of reaſon from the text to recede from the account of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> but rather to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to them.</p>
                           <p>The Queſtion is, <hi>Whether the fourth King there ſpoken of be the laſt King of the</hi> Perſian <hi>Monarchy, yea or no?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſ. Daniel</hi> ſaith not ſo, nor will his words rightly interpreted infer ſo much. The words in <hi>Daniel,</hi> (which were ſpoken in the third year of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as <hi>Daniel</hi> 10.1.) are only theſe, <hi>Behold, there ſhall ſtand up yet,</hi> (i. e. ſucceeding <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who was preſent King when this was ſpoken) <hi>three Kings in</hi> Perſia, <hi>and the fourth</hi> (i. e. the King that ſhould ſucceed theſe three) <hi>ſhall be farre richer than they all, and by his ſtrength, through his riches, he ſhall ſtir up all againſt the Realm of</hi> Graecia.</p>
                           <p>Here is not a word that the fourth ſhould bee the laſt, but that the fourth ſhould be richer than all the other, and by his ſtrength, through his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſtir up all againſt the Realm of <hi>Graecia.</hi> Now how exactly doth this anſwer to what is recorded by the <hi>Greek</hi> Hiſtorians? if we count the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Magi</hi> to be one of the three firſt Kings that ſucceeded <hi>Cyrus;</hi> for though they continued in the Government but a little while, for which cauſe ſome (as I have ſaid) confound their reign with the reign of <hi>Cambyſes;</hi> yet they being a Head diſtinct, the Scripture, which ſpeaks of things di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, and as they are, account them ſo, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding their ſhort continuance.</p>
                           <p>Now I ſay, the <hi>Magi</hi> being reckoned one of theſe three, how patly do <hi>Daniels</hi> words anſwer to the reports of the <hi>Greeks?</hi> for <hi>Cyrus</hi> they
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:115824:162"/>reckon as the firſt, and the founder of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy; after him they reckon, 1 <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> 2 The <hi>Magi.</hi> 3 <hi>Darius Hyſtaſpes.</hi> Here are the three ſtanding up after <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the fourth they mention (who ſucceeded <hi>Darius Hyſtaſpes</hi>) is <hi>Xerxes</hi> the Great, who is famouſly known in the ſtories of thoſe ancient Writers, for two things.</p>
                           <p n="1">1 For his Riches, which his Father <hi>Darius Hyſtaſpes</hi> had hoorded up, and that in ſo great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, that he was called the Hoorder of the Kingdom.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 For his notable expedition againſt <hi>Greece,</hi> carrying with him no leſſe than a Million of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers (ſome reckon them very many more, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt two Millions) which were tranſported over the Sea, with upwards of five thouſand Gallies, and other Veſſels. See Sir <hi>Walter Rawleighs</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the World, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 6. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. Theſe two things which <hi>Xerxes</hi> (who according to the <hi>Greeks</hi> was the fourth King after <hi>Cyrus</hi>) was ſo famous for, are the very things pointed at by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> as 1. That the fourth King ſhould be farre richer than they all, <hi>i. e.</hi> than all his Predeceſſors. 2. That by his ſtrength, through his riches, hee ſhould ſtir up all againſt the Realm of <hi>Graecia.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Obj. <hi>But though</hi> Daniel <hi>doth not call the fourth King after</hi> Cyrus, <hi>the laſt of the</hi> Perſian <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, yet the following words infer little leſſe; for the very next that we read of after this fourth King, is</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander <hi>the Great, verſ.</hi> 3. And a mighty King ſhall ſtand up, that ſhall rule with great Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and do according to his will. <hi>Theſe words can be underſtood of none but</hi> Alexander <hi>the Great, as the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:115824:162"/>following verſe makes appear.</hi> And when he ſhall ſtand up, his Kingdom ſhall be broken, (ſo was <hi>Alexanders</hi> by his ſudden death) and ſhall be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded towards the four Winds of Heaven, and not to his poſterity; (<hi>thus was</hi> Alexanders, <hi>who dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without iſſue, his Kingdom was divided betwixt his four chief Captains</hi>) nor according to his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which he ruled, <hi>i. e. none of</hi> Alexanders <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains were ſo potent as he; which words agree exactly to thoſe,</hi> Dan. 8. verſ. 8, 21, 22. <hi>where we have the very ſame deſcription of</hi> Alexander.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſ.</hi> I grant it, that <hi>Alexander</hi> is here meant, yet doth it not therefore follow that the fourth King before mentioned muſt be the laſt of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Monarchy, unleſſe it could be proved, that <hi>Daniels</hi> enumeration of Kings, reſpects the whole Monarchy of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> ſo as not one King more reigned in that Monarchy than is there mentioned, which I am ſure cannot be done from Scripture. The ſtory of <hi>Ezra</hi> will not at all help it, till they have proved the ſame of that alſo, viz. <hi>That it is a perfect Chronicle, and hath given us a perfect enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the</hi> Perſian <hi>Monarchs;</hi> which is a thing (as I have formerly obſerved) not in the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in thoſe Books.</p>
                           <p>But rather to put the matter out of all doubt, the buſineſſe in <hi>Daniel</hi> lyes thus. The Holy Ghoſt is treating, not of particular Kings, but of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies in generall; and therefore it is no part of his ſcope to tell us how many Kings did reign in this or that Monarchy, (which is not a thing obſerved in any of the Kingdoms afterwards ſpoken of in this Chapter, therefore ſhould not be urged as any
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:115824:163"/>part of the ſcope here) but his drift is to ſhew us;</p>
                           <p n="1">1 How many Monarchies, from that time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the time of the end, ſhould bee in the world.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 What remarkable changes ſhould be in theſe Monarchies themſelves, not as to the reign of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Kings, but as to the alteration of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 What more noted things ſhould be done in the time of theſe Monarchies, by either of them, as conſidered under this or that Government, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt Gods people that were, the <hi>Jews;</hi> or Gods people that are, the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> or againſt both in the time of the end, or the evening of the Worlds, or worldly Kingdoms day; or what more remarkable rents, occaſioning fearfull Civil broyls, Commotions, Diviſions, &amp;c. ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall this or that Monarchy within the time of its particular continuance.</p>
                           <p>And laſtly, Whence, or upon what occaſion, the tranſlation of Monarchies from one people to another (as from the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> from them to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and from them the tranſlation of the Kingdom and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and greatneſſe of the Kingdom under the whole Heaven, into the hands of another people, viz. <hi>The Saints of the moſt High, who till this day had always and ever been cruſhed, by and under theſe Monarchies</hi>) ſhould ariſe. In theſe things lies the main ſcope of the Holy Ghoſt, who doth not in the leaſt drive at ſuch a thing, as to tell us what particular Kings ſucceeded one another in this or that Monarchy, but only names things of this

                           <p>Now obſerve, the thing the Holy Ghoſt would have us learn (as ſeems to me) from the ſecond and third verſes of this Chapter, is this; <hi>As to take notice of ſuch a Monarchy as was that of the</hi> Perſians, <hi>ſo more eſpecially to minde the cauſe, and the occaſion of the tranſlation of this Monarchy from the</hi> Perſians <hi>to the</hi> Graecians, <hi>and the time when this cauſe ſhould be given, and the ground of a Quarrel betwixt theſe two Nations laid.</hi> Now to make out this, he tells us, how that after <hi>Gyrus</hi> three Kings ſhould ariſe in <hi>Perſia,</hi> and a fourth after them, which fourth ſhould be very rich, and ſtrong, and through the greatneſs of his ſtrength and riches, ſhould ſtir up all againſt the Realm of <hi>Graecia.</hi> This (as I have before ſaid) was moſt exactly to a tittle fulfilled in <hi>Xerxes</hi> the Great, who was the fourth King af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Cyrus</hi> in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy; exceeding all his Predeceſſors in power and riches, and with all his power invades the Realm of <hi>Graecia.</hi> Here now is the ground of an inveterate hatred and quarrel laid betwixt theſe two Nations, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards occaſioned the tranſlation of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; for the <hi>Greeks,</hi> though at preſent they maintained their own Cauſe, and did worſt their potent Enemie, yet was this work (as Hiſtories record) chiefly done by Sea, where (though they were but a handful to the other, yet being of the two the more skilful in Sea-affairs, and the more reſolute in this kind of fight, having withall the better ſhips) in the great Battail of <hi>Salamis</hi> they gained the day; yet when this was done, though
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:115824:164"/>hereby they delivered themſelves, were they not ſo potent by Land as to invade their enemie. But many years after, when that valiant Commander, <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great (who durſt attempt any thing) aroſe in <hi>Greece,</hi> then the bad bloud begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by this invaſion (though it were more than a Generation or two before) began to work, and the old grudge is remembred; and <hi>Alexander,</hi> in way of revenge of the old Quarrel, invades the <hi>Perſians,</hi> by which invaſion the Monarchy is tranſlated from the <hi>Perſians</hi> to the <hi>Graecians.</hi> So that the Holy Ghoſt takes notice of the Kings reigning in <hi>Perſia,</hi> only ſo farre as ſerves his turn, viz. <hi>To point out the time when the ground-work of that irreconcilable quarrel betwixt the</hi> Perſians <hi>and the</hi> Graecians <hi>ſhould be laid, which would in time prove the overthrow and tranſlation of the Monarchy, as it then was in the hands of the</hi> Perſians. This was done by <hi>Xerxes</hi> invaſion of <hi>Greece,</hi> which quarrel afterwards is taken up by <hi>Alexander,</hi> who to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the injury done to his Country (though long before) by the <hi>Perſians,</hi> invades them, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws their Power, wreſts the Monarchy out of their hands.</p>
                           <p>This is the true meaning of the place, without forcing or ſqueezing the text. Now conſider the thing, and what can more punctually agree to the Heathen ſtories than doth this of <hi>Daniel?</hi> to which, if we lay what wee have ſaid before, as touching the time betwixt the return from the Captivity, and <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> days, from both wee may conclude, That theſe ancient Writers, (though Heathens) have given us a true account
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:115824:164"/>of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy, both as touching the Perſons that reigned, and the Time how long.</p>
                           <p>And notwithſtanding the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers, as <hi>Joſephus, Philo, &amp;c.</hi> vary from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> yet are not their reports to be credited ſo much as the reports of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> and the reaſon is, becauſe we have much more ground to ſuſpect them of partiality, than the other; for <hi>Joſephus, Philo, &amp;c.</hi> might out of deſign mention ſuch Kings only as they finde in <hi>Ezra,</hi> becauſe, beſides the miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this place of <hi>Daniel,</hi> they might have ſuch a conceit that <hi>Ezraes</hi> Book was a perfect Chronicle, and therefore in naming more, ſhould croſſe not this only, but that alſo; and alſo, being <hi>Jews,</hi> might ſcorn to take a relation from the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> whom they eſteemed Lyars, and accurſed. But now the <hi>Greeks</hi> had no temptation of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture before them, which might move them out of meer deſign to be ſilent as touching any Kings that were, or tell us of Kings that were not. Nay, how can we readily think they ſhould ſo do, when as they do not only record Perſons but their Acts, of which many are things known, and famous? yea further, whereas the Hiſtory-Writers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves living at ſundry times of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, did each mention the King that reigned whilſt he lived, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> mentions <hi>Xerxes, Thucydides, Artaxerxes Longimanus; Xenophon, Darius Nothus, Artaxerxes Mnemon, &amp;c.</hi> Now is it likely they would tell ſuch lies in the very face of the times they lived in, as to endeavour to make people beleeve ſuch and ſuch Kings reigned over them, when every Childe knew the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:115824:165"/>Let us not Cenſure even Heathens beyond the rules of Reaſon, nor, becauſe we are ſick of their reports, ſpew out the truth of the Scripture with them.</p>
                           <p>This Objection therefore doth not ſo offend us, but that we may, notwithſtanding it, ſafely and truly conclude, <hi>That the number of years from</hi> Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus <hi>firſt, to</hi> Artaxerxes Mnemons <hi>twentieth (taking in each current year) are one hundred forty ſeven.</hi>

                           <p>Having found out the true and certain Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of years from <hi>Cyrus</hi> firſt, unto the year of Chriſts Paſſion, we are now to run the remaining years of the two thouſand three hundred, upon our Chriſtian Epock, or that account which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the Year of the Lord.</p>
                           <p>Here I muſt nakedly confeſſe my ſelf to bee ſhort of a clear Scripture-rule, to aſcertain us how many years have paſſed ſince the time of Chriſts Paſſion. And this I may ſay, it is a thing impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible (conſidering all Scripture Records did ceaſe ſuddenly after) that ſuch a rule ſhould be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by any, as yet; though withall I am of the minde, that a little time will furniſh us with a clear Scripture-rule (all the accounts of men being ſet aſide) to meaſure the years of the World by, and that from the day of the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, untill Chriſts ſecond coming. And leſt this ſhould ſeem a Paradox, I explain my ſelf thus; That I conceive the Scripture hath determined the whole of this time, either by particular ſums,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:115824:165"/>or groſſe ſums; now concerning every groſſe ſum this rule is to be obſerved, That the ending of this or that groſſe ſum (where the Scripture hath left us no other rule but only the groſſe ſum) can never be apprehended by a Divine Faith, but only in the accompliſhment of that thing the groſs ſum points at. When the thing is in being, then we may (though there were no account of mans in the World) ſay, now ſo many years are paſt; but before it is in being, though wee know the true beginning of the groſſe ſum, yet can we have only a Human Faith as concerning its end, <hi>i.e.</hi> to ſay, at ſuch or ſuch a time the thing pointed at by the groſſe ſum will have its accompliſhment. Now for ſo much as concerns the time from the Creation untill the ending of the ſeventy years of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, we have it all in Scripture, partly upon particular ſums, partly ſuch groſſe ſums, whoſe ends being already paſſed, they are in that reſpect as clear and demonſtrative as any particular ſum; but for the time ſince, it runs wholly upon the groſſe ſum, which groſſe ſum is this wonderfull Number of two thouſand three hundred years. Now obſerve, although we have ground (and that from the neceſſary concurrency of each Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in their end, ſo farre as the fixation of the Head of the one thouſand three hundred thirty five with <hi>Julians</hi> Act, is Scripture-proof) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that at the time when <hi>Julian</hi> ſet the <hi>Jews</hi> to re-edifie their Temple, ſo many years of the two thouſand three hundred were run out, as that the remaining years at that day were only one thouſand three hundred thirty five, yet can wee
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:115824:166"/>not upon Scripture-ground deſcend lower, untill we ſhall ſee the <hi>Jews</hi> beginning to ſtir.</p>
                           <p>When this thing ſhall be viſible, then may we, becauſe <hi>Daniel</hi> hath expreſly determined this to be forty five years before the ending of the one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand three hundred thirty five, or the two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand three hundred days, upon Scripture-ground alſo determine, That now ſo many of the two thouſand three hundred years are expired, as that the years which remain are only forty five. This therefore would bring light into the whole, and, did we ſee their ſtirring, it would be no difficult thing to meaſure by an infallible rule the years of the world, from the Creation untill Chriſts ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming, (which ſpeaks much for the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Scriptures, viz. <hi>That they alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any help of mans</hi> (could we but patiently wait for the times of manifeſtation) <hi>are throughly able to perfect every of their accounts</hi>) but, till the ſet times of manifeſtation, it cannot infallibly be; for taking it for granted, That we have upon Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-account the Heads of <hi>Daniels</hi> one thouſand two hundred and ninety, or <hi>Iohns</hi> one thouſand two hundred and ſixty years, <hi>i. e.</hi> that the one and the other muſt begin at ſuch and ſuch a year; yet muſt we (till we ſee the things in accompliſhment, that each Number points at) truſt Human Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords as to this, viz. <hi>That ſo many years from the beginning of the one or the other Number, untill this day, are run out.</hi> This I ſay, till we ſee the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of things, can never be known but by the accounts of men; but when once we ſee things in accompliſhment, then ſuppoſe men had
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:115824:166"/>kept no account at all, yet may we determine as well without them as with them; and all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions then being founded upon pure Scripture, will be infallible.</p>
                           <p>Obj. <hi>But it may be ſaid, Perhaps when theſe things pointed at by theſe Numbers ſhall come to be in accompliſhment, it will be ſo darkly, as that we ſhall not be able to diſcern it.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not ſo; for obſerve it, thoſe actions which have been the concluding-points of groſſe ſums, God did never in Old Teſtament-times bring forth in obſcurity, but clearly and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly, ſo that his people could ſee the action, and the end of the ſet time together; much leſſe therefore ſhould we expect it in New Teſtament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, in which all things are more clear. It is therefore ſufficient to call into queſtion the Head of any Number whatſoever, in caſe we ſee the whole of the time run out, and yet the thing in accompliſhment ſo dark, as that wee cannot tell whether it be fulfilled or no. God never dealt thus by his people in times of Old, when light was leſſe, therefore we are not to think he will deal thus by them in Goſpel-times, when light is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Moſt ſurely, when Gods times are run out, his very works will be ſo manifeſt, that reaſon ſhall finde no room for to object; Divine actions will then ſilence reaſoning.</p>
                           <p>I do therefore conclude, That although unto the beginning of the one thouſand three hundred thirty five days, our rule for the meaſuring of the two thouſand three hundred is clear from Scripture upon the fore-going Principle,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:115824:167"/>that theſe two Numbers end together, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whereſoever wee begin the one thouſand three hundred thirty five days, muſt we conclude, that with that time or year, whatſoever it be, muſt of neceſſity be run out exactly nine hundred ſixty five of <hi>Daniels</hi> two thouſand three hundred years; for otherwiſe the years remaining of the two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand three hundred will bee more or leſſe then one thouſand three hundred thirty five; and if ſo, then cannot the two thouſand three hundred, and the one thouſand three hundred thirty five, end together; yet as to the time ſince, till we ſee the <hi>Iews</hi> ſtirring, we cannot by any Scripture-rule de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine how many years have paſſed from that time to this.</p>
                           <p>Here therefore I freely confeſſe, wee are (and muſt be till we ſee things in accompliſhment) at a loſſe, as to our certain and infallible rule.</p>
                           <p>We may ſay, That it is a thing very probable, (and my reaſon for it I ſhall give by and by) that our Chriſtian Epock (more eſpecially within this time) hath given us a true account, and neither loſt nor gained years; but to conclude the thing abſolutely, becauſe the teſtimony, though ever ſo true, is but Human, we may not.</p>
                           <p>Though therefore I determine upon a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar year, yet not ſo abſolutely, but that I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, That in caſe men in their accounts of that time, which at preſent to us is undetermined by Scripture, have loſt or gained years; by ſo much will things in accompliſhment fall either ſooner or later than the year I have fixed upon.</p>
                           <p>Now, though I will not here take upon me to
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:115824:167"/>determine (as judging the thing upon a pure Scripture-account indeterminable) whether <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligers</hi> account of the Year of our Lord, or the vulgar account be the true (only adde, That ſhould the firſt, which fixeth the day of Chriſts Birth two years higher than the vulgar account, be the truth, then the one thouſand two hundred &amp; ſixty days, the one thouſand two hundred &amp; nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, do end with the end of the preſent year, one thouſand ſix hundred fifty four; but if the laſt, viz. the vulgar have the truth in it, then do they end with the end of the year, one thouſand ſix hundred fifty ſix, the year I have always hitherto pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon for the Witneſſes Riſe, <hi>Iews</hi> ſtirring, &amp;c. though I confeſs I am in a great doubt, which we are to hold to, but leſſe than twelve Months will untie this knot, and unriddle this Myſtery;) yet that neither account, though they vary two years as to their beginning, have ſince upon their reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning either loſt or gained years, ſeems to mee a probable truth upon our fore-going Principle, viz. of the concurrence of the two thouſand three hundred, and the one thouſand three hundred thirty five days, in their end. For ſuppoſing ſome miſcarriage may have crept into either of theſe, or rather both (for ſetting aſide their ſmall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as touching the beginning, they both, as to number of years ſince Chriſt, ſpeak the very ſame thing) in all likelihood the miſcarriage muſt bee within the time of the firſt three hundred years; for ſince that time Chriſtian Religion hath been the Religion of a principal part of the World, and hath always gone upon a publique date; but
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:115824:168"/>now in caſe any miſcarriage were in that time, then ſeeing we muſt after once <hi>Daniels</hi> one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand three hundred thirty five years are begun, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the like number of years (viz. one thouſand three hundred thirty five) of the two thouſand three hundred, to it, that theſe two by this allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance may concur in one end; it will follow, that ſo many years over or under as the miſcarriage hath been, ſo many years, by that time we have counted the years of the two thouſand three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred before Chriſts Paſſion, and the years of the two thouſand three hundred which follow the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the one thouſand three hundred thirty five, will be found within this time (viz. betwixt Chriſts Paſſion, and the beginning of the one thouſand three hundred thirty five years) over or under the general ſum of two thouſand three hundred; for if the years within this time have been counted more than they ſhould, then will the totall ſum of the years be more upon account of the whole time put together, than two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand three hundred; if leſſe, then leſſe; ſo that the two thouſand three hundred muſt by this means either be ſtretched or crooked, neither of which muſt be; for this, two thouſand three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, is of all, the moſt exquiſite and perfect rule to meaſure times by, it being the very Date that Heaven hath ſet upon all worldly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, the account that the wonderfull Numbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of times and ſeaſons hath left us. It there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being a thing Divine, determines of all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts that are Human, but ſuffers it ſelf to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by none.</p>
                           <pb n="305" facs="tcp:115824:168"/>
                           <p>This Harmony therefore of the two thouſand three hundred years, and the one thouſand three hundred thirty five in their end, as it doth deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the truth of all our account till <hi>Julian,</hi> viz. That we muſt of neceſſity reckon nine hundred ſixty five years, of the two thouſand three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, to be expired at the time of <hi>Julians</hi> Act, not a year more or leſſe, for if upwards of nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſixty five years were expired before <hi>Julian,</hi> then would there not be one thouſand three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thirty five remaining; if leſſe, then more, either of which deſtroys the harmony: So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe doth it determine, that in all probability our Chriſtian Epock hath neither loſt nor gained years from that time to this day, becauſe if any where it had loſt or gained years, it is likely it ſhould be within the firſt three hundred years; but there it did not, therefore much more unlikely that ſince, (when Chriſtian Religion hath been more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and gone upon the publique Date of the greateſt Empire in the World) it ſhould have loſt or gained any.</p>
                           <p>Having thus made good the whole of our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, there is nothing now remaining but that we caſt it up, to the end we may ſee where, or with what year <hi>Daniels</hi> two thouſand three hundred years expire.</p>
                           <p>For the better doing hereof I ſhall divide the whole into Six Periods.</p>

                           <p>The years of the three firſt, and the three laſt Periods put together, make up exactly 2300.</p>

                        <head>A General Rule for the right underſtanding of Prophecies, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a more full opening the great Myſtery of <hi>Daniels</hi> little Horn.</head>
                        <p>IT is a moſt certain truth, <hi>That every Prophecy left us in the Word of God, hath in it ſelf ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Characters to lead us, by comparing the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of it with the minde of God in other Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, to the knowledge of the ſubſtance of that truth that is in it held forth;</hi> for otherwiſe the word ſhould be imperfect, and not able to expound it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>Theſe <hi>Characters</hi> are the <hi>Keys</hi> of this or that Prophecy, which when found, it will be eaſie to unlock it; but if theſe be miſſed, all mens endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours in opening Prophecies will be in vain, and their labours loſt.</p>
                        <p>Theſe <hi>Keys,</hi> in ſome Prophecies where a man can hardly go any way but one, are quickly and with eaſe found; but in others, where by reaſon of the various turnings and windings there ſeem to be as many ways to go in as there are words, the finding of them is a thing moſt hard; and the
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:115824:172"/>Searcher, in caſe he have not a better guide than himſelf, ſhall never finde them.</p>
                        <p>The knowledge of the true <hi>Keys</hi> of any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie from <hi>Counterfeit ones,</hi> ariſeth from the <hi>fitneſs of the Keys</hi> to the Wards of the Lock, <hi>i.e.</hi> to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of the Prophecie it ſelf, and all other Prophecies concurrent with it; for this is certain, that if the <hi>true Key</hi> be found, it will open whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever lyes within that Prophecy, or any other that hath dependence upon it. Hence, thoſe <hi>Keys</hi> how neatly ſoever they may be wrought, which will open but a part of a Prophecy, but not the whole, are not the true Keys, but counterfeit.</p>
                        <p>Two things there are that are abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the finding of theſe Keys.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 <hi>An Affection to any pre-conceived opinion that may bee in a man, as touching this or that Prophecy, before yet hee hath found the certain Key thereof.</hi> So farre as any ſuch thing is in any, inſtead of ſeeking the true key, hee will make a key, and form it to his own opinion.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 <hi>A founding Concluſions</hi> (which ſhould all bee built upon manifeſt demonſtrations taken from the naked Letter of the Text, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther foundation) <hi>upon Allegories,</hi> i. e. becauſe many things in this or that Prophecy ſeeme fairly to allude to ſuch or ſuch an event, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt that event needs be the meaning of the Prophecy.</p>
                        <p>This is the moſt fallible way of interpreting Prophecies of all other; for how eaſie a thing is it, conſidering that ſome Prophecies (as <hi>Daniels</hi> for
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:115824:172"/>inſtance) lead us through many Ages, as many as amount to no leſſe than two thouſand years and upwards, that within ſo long a time a man ſhould finde more occurrencies than one that will in many things agree to what is fore-told in ſuch or ſuch a Prophecy?</p>
                        <p>Hence come thoſe innumerable miſtakes of Expoſitors, both of former, later, and preſent times alſo, they run (without a due reſpect to the indubitable Characters of the text) the meaning of this or that Prophecy, upon this or the other likely event, and ſo, as many likely events as mens reading or wits can help them to, ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations ſhall we have of the Prophecy. And this evil hath crept in, by that in ſome ſenſe good, but as it is ordinarily underſtood and made uſe of, greatly abuſed Saying, viz. <hi>That the beſt Interpreter of Prophecies is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is a moſt dangerous thing therefore to run from the naked Letter of the text, when the meaning of any Prophecy is ſought after, to Allegorical flouriſhes, becauſe where the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is ſet aſide, and the Allegory made the rule of interpretation, there can be no certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of truth, in regard Allegorical interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are as various as mens inventions.</p>
                        <p>Now how a man ſhall ever bee able to judge of truth in variety, in caſe he have not ſome other rule to walk by than that which produceth this variety, I cannot tell.</p>
                        <p>Although therefore it is confeſſed, that many
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:115824:173"/>phraſes in this or the other Prophecy do require a Spiritual meaning to be put upon them; yet (I ſay) the <hi>Characters themſelves,</hi> by which this or that Prophecy, as to ſcope and time, is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from all others, are ever to be looked for in the naked letter of the Text, which is the only ſtanding and fixed rule, and not in any Myſtical or Spiritual interpretations, which are as variable and uncertain as mens imaginations; and in caſe theſe <hi>general Characters</hi> which are deducible only from the letter, are once found, it will be then a thing more eaſie to give a right ſenſe of particular Phraſes, and to determine concerning them, in which we are to cleave to the literal, in which to ſeek a Spiritual interpretation.</p>
                        <p>For an example, I ſhall pitch upon <hi>Daniels little Horn,</hi> which as it is one of the moſt famous Prophecies in all the Scripture; ſo is there not any one (I mean that is ſo conſiderable) that hath fallen under more miſ-interpretations then it; which miſtakes are multiplied daily through that earneſt inquiry that by the Saints of this Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made after the minde of <hi>Daniel;</hi> and though it may be thought, enough as to it hath been already ſaid in the precedent Diſcourſe, yet becauſe ſome through weakneſſe cannot, others byaſſed with ſome particular affection to this, or the other opinion, will not apply thoſe things as they ought to be applied, I thought it not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet to take up this Prophecy here again, and make it the example of my Rule.</p>
                        <p>Now the <hi>ſure and certain Characters</hi> of this <hi>little Horn,</hi> which are deducible from the letter of
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:115824:173"/>the text, and which (all put together) cannot be made agree to any opinion but only that which is the truth, are ſuch as theſe.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 CHARACTER, <hi>The Kingdom of the little Horn muſt be in the latter days;</hi> the reaſon is, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the extreme and utmost part of</hi> Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zars <hi>great Image, viz. the feet and toes,</hi> Dan. 2.41, 42, 43. <hi>are the ſame with the little Horn,</hi> Chap. 7. This needs no proving, becauſe it is univerſally granted, whatſoever interpretation is by any put upon the <hi>little Horn,</hi> carries along with it this conceſſion, That the little Horns Kingdom, cha. 7. and the feet and toes of <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Image, chap. 2. are the ſame, at leaſtwiſe in reſpect of time. Now the feet and toes of <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Image falls within the later days; the reaſon is, becauſe the Image it ſelf brings us down to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter days, verſ. 28. which cannot be, in caſe the feet and toes which are the extreme and utmoſt part thereof, were not to be extended as farre as the latter days.</p>
                        <p>To whoſe Kingdom this phraſe is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly appliable, the Apoſtles uſe of the ſame phraſe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3. doth clearly teach us.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 CHARACTER, <hi>This Kingdom of the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Horn muſt neceſſarily appertain to the</hi> Roman <hi>Monarchy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That it cannot belong to the <hi>Graetian</hi> is clear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchy, whether we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it as united under <hi>Alexander,</hi> or as in its four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold diviſion afterwards, is comprehended under the third Beaſt, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.6. but now the Kingdom of the <hi>little Horn</hi> belongs not to the third Beaſt,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:115824:174"/>for the Little Horn ariſeth among the ten Horns of the fourth, verſ. 8.</p>
                        <p>That it cannot be any power diſtinct from, and ſucceeding the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, is alſo clear.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 Becauſe no place in <hi>Daniel</hi> or elſewhere doth ſo much as once countenance any ſuch opinion as this, viz. <hi>That there ſhould be any worldly Government ſucceeding the</hi> Roman <hi>Monarchy.</hi> Nay, let me ſay, the Scripture is clear againſt ſuch a Notion, for it is manifeſt, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.12, 13, 14. <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.11, 12. compared with verſ. 19, 20. That the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Beaſt, (<hi>i.e.</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Antichriſt) is upon the appearance of Chriſt; if ſo, where ſhall we then finde room for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the <hi>little Horn</hi> to ſucceed the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy?</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Becauſe the Beaſt is ſlain, his body deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and given to the burning flame: and that for the blaſphemies of the <hi>little Horn,</hi> Dan. 7.11. This Beaſt (I ſay) can be no other but the fourth and laſt Beaſt, verſ. 7. which Beaſt is the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy.</p>
                        <p>Hence I gather two things.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 <hi>That the government of the little Horn cannot be a Government diſtinct from the</hi> Roman <hi>Monarchy,</hi> a thing the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy hath nothing to do with; for then, why is the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for the blaſphemies of the <hi>little Horn?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2 <hi>That the Government of the little Horn cannot be a government ſucceeding the</hi> Roman <hi>Monarchy;</hi> for it is moſt clear from the words, That the fourth Beaſts Kingdom is in being, and that at the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:115824:174"/>time the little Horn blaſphemes. Now it would be improper to ſay, That the little Horns Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſucceeds the Fourth Monarchy, and yet that Monarchy ſtill in being, even in the time of the little Horns Dominion.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Becauſe if the little Horns Kingdom, or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ſucceed the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, then have we in <hi>Daniel</hi> five Monarchies preceding the Kingdom of Chriſt and his Saints, viz.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 The Monarchy of the <hi>Babylonians.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2 Of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3 Of the <hi>Graecians.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4 Of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5 The Monarchy or Government of the little Horn. If ſo, then muſt not Chriſts Kingdom hee called the Fifth Monarchy, but the Sixth.</p>
                        <p>If therefore the little Horn can neither belong to the <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchy, nor ſucceed the <hi>Roman,</hi> then muſt the ſame of neceſſity appertain to the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 CHARACTER, <hi>The Little Horn muſt be a power equivalent to the whole body of the Fourth Monarchy.</hi> This is clear, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. which Prophecy conſiders the Fourth Kingdom. 1 As an Iron Kingdom, <hi>verſ.</hi> 40. 2 As a Kingdom of Iron and Clay, <hi>verſ.</hi> 41, 42, 43. yet both but one Kingdom, and therefore that which is called the Fourth Kingdom, <hi>verſ.</hi> 40. is called the Kingdom, <hi>verſ.</hi> 41, 42. ſhewing us, That the Holy Ghoſt was ſtill ſpeaking of one and the ſame Kingdom, for otherwiſe he would for diſtinction ſake have called the feet of Iron and Clay another King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but calling it the Kingdom, it hath a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:115824:175"/>reference to that Kingdom he had mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned laſt, viz. the Fourth, which Kingdom is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an Iron Kingdom, to ſet forth the ſtate before Antichriſt came in, a Kingdom of Iron and Clay, to ſet forth the ſtate afterwards.</p>
                        <p>They that would ſee more reaſon hereof, may conſult with our fore-going Diſcourſe.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 CHARACTER, <hi>The little Horn ſignifies ſuch a power as conſiſts of ten parts, which ten parts are ſo many Kings, not ſucceeding in one and the ſame Kingdom, but reigning in a Kingdom divided into ten parts.</hi> This appears <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.41, 42, 43, 44. for the Power here mentioned (which is the ſame with the little Horn, Chap. 7.) conſiſts of ten toes, <hi>verſ.</hi> 42. which toes are called Kings, <hi>verſ.</hi> 44. <hi>In the days of theſe Kings ſhall the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſet up a Kingdom;</hi> which words cannot have relation to all the Four Monarchies; for the God of Heaven ſet up no Kingdom, no not in a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſenſe, in the time of any of the Four, but the laſt only; why ſhould it then be ſaid, <hi>theſe Kings</hi> in the plural number? if not to give us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,</p>
                        <p n="1">1 That the ten toes here ſpoken of are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of ſo many Kings.</p>

                        <p>Again obſerve, That theſe Kings are not to be underſtood of ſo many Kings reigning ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in one and the ſame Kingdom, but muſt of
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:115824:175"/>Kings reigning contemporary in ſo many diſtinct Kingdoms, which Kingdoms (though diſtinct in themſelves, yet) do all meet in one common Head, as the toes do all meet in the feet, This is evidenced, not only by the diſtinction of the toes in themſelves, but alſo by the diviſion of the fourth or grand Kingdom among them, ſo as that no one hath the whole, but one hath this part, another that, therefore it is ſaid to be divided, <hi>verſ.</hi> 41.

So Chap. 11.33. <hi>They that underſtand among the people ſhall inſtruct many, yet they ſhall fall by the Sword, and by flame, by Captivity, and by ſpoyl many

                        </p>
                        <p>The Conception of ſome good men of our days is, That the little Horns Kingdom doth not denote the whole body of Antichriſt, but points
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:115824:178"/>at ſome ſingular Perſon or Power that is to ariſe in the evening time of Antichriſts Kingdom; ſo making in their concluſion the Saints of this Age to be the only ſubjects of the Little Horns rage.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1 <hi>This is very improbable,</hi> though it were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no other reaſon but the former only, <hi>viz.</hi> the loſſe of ſo much, and withall ſo remarkable a time, as is, and muſt be loſt by this opinion.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 <hi>Very uncomfortable;</hi> for ſuppoſing the Little Horn to be but newly riſen, yet if withall wee conſider thoſe things which are moſt evident from the text, concerning him. 1. That his continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance muſt be long. 2 That throughout this long time, he ſhall in a moſt fearful and diſmal manner rage and tyrannize, trample the Saints, oppreſs the Nations; What an uncomfortable opinion is this to us, and all the people of God at this day, who look for their redemption to be at hand, to entertain ſuch a thought, that the Little Horns Kingdom is but now begun? which if ſo, then ſure enough neither we, nor our Childrens Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, no nor the Generation after them, ſhall ever live to behold thoſe glorious days, which, yet is the faith of many, will break forth even in this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. Nay how uncomfortable a thing is it, to think that all the Perſecutions that have every yet been in the World, are in a manner but Flea-bites, both for greatneſſe and length of time, to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution that is now beginning? which muſt be in caſe the Kingdom of the Little Horn be but now begun; for <hi>he</hi> is the only Perſecutor of the Saints, and oppreſſor of the Nations by way of eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:115824:179"/>that Monſter that never had the like before him, nor ſhall have after him.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 <hi>Grounded upon a miſtake,</hi> which miſtake is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conception of ſome, who are of opinion that the Little Horn denotes a ſingle Perſon, viz. That the Little Horns riſe and rage is to be the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate fore-runner of the Beaſts final ruine, and that for this reaſon the deſcription of this Little Horn is inſiſted upon ſo largely in <hi>Daniels</hi> Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
                        <p>But this cannot be,</p>
                        <p n="1">1 Becauſe it is needleſſe and ſuperfluous ſo much ſhould be fore-told of this Little Horn, to this end only, when as in caſe nothing had been ſpoken of him, we have a more ſure, certain, and undoubted word to point us to the ending-time of the Beaſts reign, viz. <hi>the truth of thoſe ſoveral myſtical numbers that concern the Beaſt;</hi> It is unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintedneſs with the one hath made good men ſo apt to cloſe in with this other.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Becauſe the deſtruction of that which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the whole of the Beaſts Kingdom, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a ſign of the deſtruction of the Beaſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; but ſo doth the Little Horn; for it is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to the whole body of the Fourth Monarchy, and is a Power conſiſting of ten Kingdoms, as I have before proved.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 The fore-going conception <hi>ſavours too much of partiality, and of too high thoughts of our ſelves, and too low of the Saints before us,</hi> whilſt in effect by ſuch a concluſion we render the Holy Ghoſt mindeleſs of all the ſufferings of ſo many Millions of the precicus Servants of Jeſus Chriſt, who in
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:115824:179"/>former Ages have in the flames, by Sword, and otherwiſe, ſacrificed their lives for the teſtimony of Jeſus, againſt the Beaſt, as not to mention one word of all their ſufferings; and yet ſo mindful of us, who comparatively with them have never ſuffered the thouſandth part, nor can ſuffer more ſhould men do their worſt, as to leave ſuch a large Narrative of our afflictions.</p>
                        <p>Nay further let me adde, (which follows up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the other) <hi>we do hereby in a manner accuſe the moſt righteous God of partiality and inequality,</hi> whilſt we make him to forget all his other Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren much better than we, and to take notice of us, and our ſufferings only. Let us not have ſo much affection to our ſelves, as not only to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide all due reſpect to that bleſſed cloud of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes our Fore-runners and Betters, but alſo to make the ways of the moſt righteous God une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual; yet this (remembring what but now was ſaid, that in caſe by the Little Horns rage and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy the tyranny of Antichriſt be not ſet forth, no mention at all is by <hi>Daniel</hi> made thereof) doth neceſſarily follow, ſuch a conception being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
                        <p>The ſum of all is, <hi>That as thoſe Charactors of truth left us in the naked letter of the text, are the moſt certain rule to go by, to finde the minde of the Holy Ghost in Prophecies; ſo walking by that rule,</hi> Daniels <hi>Little Horn is, and can be no other, but, the whole body of the Romiſh Antichriſt.</hi>

                        <head>A particular Clauſe, in our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe about the Times, opened.</head>
                        <p>IT hath been ſaid in the cloſe of my fore-going Diſcourſe about the times, <hi>That (it cannot bee determined from Scripture, whether the preſent year one thouſand ſix hundred fifty four, or tho ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching year, one thouſand ſix hundred fifty ſix, be the laſt of the Beaſts reign, and the Witneſſes wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſackcloth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ground of this uncertainty lies in the doubtfulneſs of the year of our Saviours Birth, which although the Scripture tells us it was in the days of <hi>Augustus Gaeſar,</hi> yet in regard it hath not, told us, how long the ſaid <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, therefore the doubt remaineth. Nor will Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Records help us herein, becauſe they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided within themſelves, and differ ſome from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers a year or two, as touching the number of the years the ſaid <hi>Auguſtus</hi> reigned.</p>
                        <p>Two opinions there are about the time of Chriſts Birth, the one fixing it two years higher, the other two years lower. The Vulgar Account, (which wee have followed, becauſe the moſt known, and the common Date) inclineth to the latter. The account of <hi>Scaliger</hi> (which is owned by other Modern Chronologers, as <hi>Calviſius, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtedius, Helvicus,</hi> &amp;c.) chuſeth the former.</p>
                        <pb n="328" facs="tcp:115824:180"/>
                        <p>The difference betwixt theſe cannot be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by Scripture, nor can it be certainly made appear, till the event hath decided it, which is the truth.</p>
                        <p>Our proof from Scripture is firm and good, that the year one thouſand ſix hundred fifty ſix from the birth of Chriſt, muſt neceſſarily be the laſt year of the Beaſts reign, and the Witneſſes wearing ſackcloth.</p>
                        <p>This is demonſtrable from the two thouſand three hundred days; for ſith that with the year of Chriſts Paſſion, which was, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> thirty four, ſix hundred thirty three of <hi>Daniels</hi> two thouſand three hundred yeers were expired (as I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) it therefore follows, that from that year to the end of the Fourth Monarchy are to be reckoned but one thouſand ſix hundred ſixty ſeven years more, which one thouſand ſix hundred ſixty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years being added to the former number ſix hundred thirty three, as they make up the two thouſand three hundred years (which are the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt date of the Fourth Monarchy) compleat; ſo do they alſo make the two thouſand three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years to expire with the year from Chriſts Birth, one thouſand ſeven hundred and one, for adde one thouſand ſix hundred ſixty ſeven to thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four (the year in which Chriſt ſuffered) and we have the aforeſaid ſum. Now in regard the end of the Beaſts reign, and the Witneſſes wearing Sackcloth falls forty five years before the final deſtruction of the Fourth Monarchy, it therefore follows (the Date of the Fourth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy expiring in the year one thouſand ſeven

                        <p>But now, becauſe the time of Chriſts Birth is (as to the year) doubtful, therefore (I ſay) can it not be determined what year we are to pitch upon, as the year one thouſand ſix hundred fifty ſix from the Birth of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>If the account of <hi>Scaliger</hi> (which aſcends two years above the vulgar) be the truth, then of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity (in caſe years ſince Chriſt in the counting have not been loſt, as it is a thing very improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble any ſhould, upon the reaſon we have given in the precedent Diſcourſe) muſt this preſent year one thouſand ſix hundred fifty four, be the laſt of the Beaſts reign, and the Witneſſes wearing ſackcloth; for in caſe Chriſts Birth be to be fixed two years higher than the beginning of our Vulgar account, it will follow, that the year which we (following the Vulgar account) call the year one thouſand ſix hundred fifty four, ought to be accounted, and really is, from Chriſts Birth the year one thouſand ſix hundred fifty ſix; and if ſo, then will the next year after this be the year in which the <hi>German</hi> Witneſſes, and the Saints elſewhere ſhall put off their Sackcloth, and be no longer ſubject to the tyranny of the Beaſt. But if the Vulgar account be true, then will the year we commonly call fifty ſix be the laſt year of the Beaſts tyranny, and the Witneſſes wearing Sackcloth, and conſequently
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:115824:181"/>with the beginning of the year one thouſand ſix hundred fifty ſeven muſt wee expect the bleſſed day of the Saints putting off their Sackcloth, and leading into captivity that Beaſt, that for one thouſand two hundred and ſixty years together hath captivated them. This being a queſtion of great moment, which makes a variance two years throughout all our accounts, and withal not being (as I judge) determinable by Scripture, unleſſe (as I have ſaid) it could be proved how many years <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> reigned, which in caſe it could be done, then indeed <hi>Johns</hi> beginning to preach in the fifteenth year of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> Luke 3.1. would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what help us, I thought good (having but hinted it before) to give here in our cloſe the true and full ſtate thereof, leaving the two different accounts to the Readers conſideration, and the certain deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the thing it ſelf to the event; Only adding, that although in my account of times I have walked by the Vulgar reckoning, as that which is to perſons generally beſt known, yet have I not done it from any ſuch light, as perſwades me, that the Vulgar account is to be choſen and adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto rather than the other; therefore having ſhewed where this knot lies, I leave it to time and Divine Providence to unty. A few days wil reſolve this queſtion, and many more.</p>

So <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.13. compared with <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16.) and is that thing of which all the Prophets have ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>II.</label> A Type of this Kingdom was the Kingdom of the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> erected in the midſt of Gods peculiar, in time of old, and bearing rule over the Nations about it. Hence Chriſt as King goes fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently under the name of <hi>David, Ezek.</hi> 34.23, 24. <hi>Chap.</hi> 37.24, 25. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>III.</label> This Kingdom became, in time, ſubjected by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and after that wholly remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:115824:184"/>(the Scepter being taken away) by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> at the time of Chriſts firſt coming, ſo that from <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> time until this day, no outward viſible Kingdom, which may bee called Chriſts, hath been in the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>IV.</label> Yet an outward viſible Kingdom Chriſt ſhall have, elſe could not the Promiſe have its fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, nor the Type its Anti-type.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>V.</label> But yet as <hi>Davids</hi> Kingdom, the Type, was very little in its beginning, and afterwards became a Monarchy, bearing rule over the Nations about it: ſo doth this Kingdom of Chriſt begin as a Stone, afterwards becomes a Mountain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>VI.</label> Further, as <hi>Davids</hi> Kingdom went to decay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſts firſt coming, its abſolute Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being taken away by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> yet had not the Scepter wholly removed untill the time of his coming: So doth this Kingdom begin to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, as it is the Stone, before Chriſts ſecond coming, therefore ſaid to be ſet up in the days of the ten Kings, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.44. yet ſhall it not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly a great Mountain (or a Monarchy bearing rule over all the earth) untill this coming.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>VII.</label> Yet as God is ſwift to take Vengeance for his people, but ſlow to take vengeance upon them: So when God comes to recover this outward Kingdom, by breaking in peeces all worldly Powers that now poſſeſſe it, the time betwixt the beginning of this work, (which begins with the
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:115824:184"/>time where the Stone begins to ſmite) and the compleating of it, is by the determinate Counſel of God much ſhorter, than was the time betwixt the ſubjecting and total removing of that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going outward Kingdom, which was the Type of this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>VIII.</label> As the people of God in the time of the Old and New Teſtament both, did and do by faith expect this Kingdom, and ſhall accordingly, when the ſame ſhall be ſet up be Joynt-heirs, and Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritors thereof: So hath God given us perfect aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it, and how, and when the ſame ſhall bee erected, and what ſhould befall the people of the Old Teſtament, and of the New alſo, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Ages till the erecting of it, and that out of the mouthes of two infallible Witneſſes, <hi>viz. Daniel</hi> a Prophet of the Old Teſtament, and <hi>John</hi> an Apoſtle of the New.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>IX.</label> The ſcope of <hi>Daniels</hi> Prophecies, which begin, ſome with, ſome ſuddenly after, the time where the Kingdom of the Type was ſubjected, and terminate with the compleat ſetting up of the Kingdom of the Anti-type; is to give full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the thing it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> That this Kingdom, which for many Ages together before <hi>Daniels</hi> time had had being in the Type, ſhould alſo after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny days have being in the Anti-type; and alſo to give certain knowledge (that thereby the faith of Gods people throughout this long time might be the better born up in a patient expectation of this Kingdom) how, and by whom the Scepter of the World ſhould be ſwayed from that day, in
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:115824:185"/>which the Kingdom of the Houſe of <hi>David</hi> was ſubjected, until the time the ſame ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored with greater Power and Glory, and more Dominion, than ever before it had, under Chriſt the true <hi>David.</hi> And for this reaſon it is that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> takes notice of no worldly Monarch before <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> by and under whom <hi>Davids</hi> Kingdom was ſubjected.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>X.</label> As this outward viſible Kingdom, throughout this long Period, was by Divine appointment to fall into the hands of four great Monarchies, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 The <hi>Babylonians,</hi> 2 <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> 3 <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> 4 <hi>Romans,</hi> which one after the other ſhould poſſeſſe the Kingdom, and bear rule over all the earth, till in the end that Ruler ſhould come, whoſe goings out have been from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, and whoſe right by Purchaſe, Promiſe, and Donation of the Father, the Kingdom is, and take the ſame from the laſt of theſe into his own hands: So anſwerably in the Book of <hi>Daniel</hi> wee have in four Prophecies (his Seventy weeks ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, which treat of another thing) theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, the time of their reign determined, and their final ruine (and therewith the revolution of the Kingdom into the hands of Chriſt, and his Saints) fore-told.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>XI.</label> The Four-fold Repetition of the ſame things, or the ſpeaking of the ſame things over in four Prophecies, was, to the end <hi>Daniel</hi> might have light let in by degrees, as he was able to bear it, and alſo, that it might be ſet home more ſtrongly
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:115824:185"/>upon his heart, and the hearts of Gods people in general, to whom theſe glorious Diſcoveries were made, that the things themſelves were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed by God, and ſhould moſt certainly be fulfilled in their ſeaſon, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.32.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>XII.</label> The Prophecies themſelves are, 1 That of the great Image, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 2 That of the four Beaſts, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 3 That of the Ram, Hee-Goat, and Little Horn, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. Laſtly, Of the King of the North, and King of the South, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. the matter contained in the three firſt of theſe is repreſented to <hi>Daniel</hi> by way of Viſion, in the laſt, by lively voyce.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>XIII.</label> The two firſt of theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That of the Great Image, and that of the four Beaſts, comprehend within them all the four Monarchies; the two laſt, the three laſt only; the reaſon whereof is, becauſe <hi>Daniel</hi> had not his two laſt Viſions till the expiration of the firſt, or <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy: Now Prophecies being not of things paſt, but to come, therefore the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy being paſſed at the time of the two laſt Viſions, no mention at all is made in them of that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>XIV.</label> The ſucceſſion of theſe four Monarchies is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently ſet forth in that golden Method, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that is obſerved in each of the aforeſaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies; the deſcription of them in that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful ſuitableneſſe and harmony that is in the matter.</p>
                  <pb n="340" facs="tcp:115824:186"/>
                  <p>
                     <label>XV.</label> The <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy is the firſt, to which the Images head of fine Gold, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.32. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with 37, 38. and that firſt Beaſt, Chap. 7.4. do relate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>XVI.</label> The <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> ſucceed the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> to whoſe Monarchy belongeth the ſilver Breaſt, and Arms of the Great Image, Chap. 2.32. The ſecond Beaſt, chap. 7.5. The Ram with two Horns, Chap. 8.3, 4, compared with verſ. 20. and what by lively voyce is ſpoken to <hi>Daniel,</hi> Chap. 11. verſ. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>XVII.</label> The two Arms joyned to one Breaſt, which is the <hi>Perſian</hi> reſemblance, Chap. 2. and the two Horns growing upon one Head, which is their reſemblance, Chap. 8. are a moſt lively embleme of two powerful Nations, <hi>viz. Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> either of which hath an Arm, &amp; a Horn of ſtrength, uniting into one, to make a Monarchy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>XVIII.</label> The third Monarchy is of the <hi>Graecians,</hi> which is conſidered in <hi>Daniel,</hi> Firſt, as united in one; Secondly, as divided and broken.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>XIX.</label> To the <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchy, in its united ſtate, doth belong that devouring belly, which ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers all to it ſelf, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.32. That third Beaſt, conſidered as winged, and ſwift in motion, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.6. (which ſwiftneſſe of march is noted as pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to <hi>Alexander,</hi> Dan. 8.5. and is here excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſet forth by giving four Wings, <hi>i. e.</hi> two
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:115824:186"/>pair of Wings to this Beaſt, noting his ſwift march, and ſpeedy conqueſts) the Great and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Horn of the rough Goat, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.5. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with verſ. 21. and what is ſpoken to <hi>Daniel</hi> of that mighty King, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>XX.</label> The divided ſtate of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchy, is ſet forth by the thighs of the great Image, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.32. the four Heads of the third Beaſt, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.6. the four Horns of the He-Goat coming up in the room of the great Horn, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.8. with verſ. 22. and what by voyce is delivered to <hi>Daniel</hi> chap. 11. ver. 4, 5, &amp;c. to ver. 14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>XXI.</label> The Fourth and laſt Monarchy is of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> which Monarchy in either Prophecy is ſet forth in its two-fold ſtate. Firſt, its ſtate before Antichriſts riſe. Secondly, its ſtate afterwards; the one I have formerly called its pure Civil State, the other its mixt State.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>XXII.</label> The <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy in its firſt State, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it chiefly attended to the work of Conquering, and ſubduing Nations, is ſet forth by the Iron Leggs of the great Image, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.33. which I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron-legged Kingdom, or rather this fourth King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom conſidered as Iron-legged, is ſaid to break in peeces, and ſubdue all things, verſ. 40. By the fourth Beaſt, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.7. but yet conſidered only as a warlike Beaſt, moſt dreadful and terrible to the Nations, devouring the whole earth, treading it down, and breaking it in peeces, verſ. 23. By the Little Horn, conſidered in its firſt waxing great,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:115824:187"/>
                     <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.9. by which waxing it becomes exceeding great, puſhing down all ſtanding in its way, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the South, and towards the Weſt, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the pleaſant Land; and by what is ſpoken to <hi>Daniel,</hi> of the Conqueſts of the King of the North, verſ. 14. to 21.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>XXIII.</label> The <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy in its ſecond State, wherein the work it principally attends to, is, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the Nations ſubdued already, perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Saints, treading under-foot the Holy City, is ſet forth by the feet of the great Image of Iron and Clay, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.33. by the Little Horn, Cha. 7. by the Little Horn in its ſecond waxing great, Chap. 8.10, 11, 12, 24, 25. by the vile Perſon, or that proud King, Chap. 11. whoſe deſcription we have at large, verſ. 21. to verſ. 40. and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards goes under the title of the King of the North, ver. 40. to the end of the Chapter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>XXIV.</label> All the aforeſaid Prophecies, though their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings are different, yet have they but one and the ſame general end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>XXV.</label> This end is the final diſſolution of the Fourth Monarchy, and the eſtabliſhment of the Fifth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary with both which is the Perſonal appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>XXVI.</label> The two laſt Prophecies conclude with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Fourth Monarchy, the two firſt with the greatneſſe and glory of the Fifth, yet are not for this reaſon their ends different, becauſe,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:115824:187"/>though the things themſelves are two, yet both ſhall be performed by that one act of Chriſts Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal appearance. It is the appearance of Chriſt that deſtroys the Fourth Monarchy, eſtabliſheth the Fifth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>XXVII.</label> The admirable Harmony in every title betwixt theſe ſo antient Prophecies and the events; or betwixt the things fore-told ſo many Ages ago, and the things tranſacted in the Ages ſince, is a ſtrong and convincing Argument of the infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Prophecies themſelves, and of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the performance of the things yet to bee accompliſhed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>XXVIII.</label> The glorious work of ſetting up Chriſts out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward viſible Kingdom, which is the thing poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at in all the fore-going Prophecies, is the great work of the preſent age, and time we live in.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>XXIX.</label> The myſtical Numbers of <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>John</hi> both, which direct us to the time in which this Kingdom is to be ſet up, all which expire (as the fore-going Diſcourſe proveth) within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of this Age; the viſible diſpenſations of God, which in our days have been very wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, all tending to ſuch a thing; the cries of Saints, and their faith and expectations generally looking this way; the oppoſition of the Devil, and the World againſt, and the malignity of men of worldly Principles, unto this glorious truth, and bleſſed work, do all ſpeak that we are come to the dawning of that day in which Chriſt will, in
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:115824:188"/>deſpite of Satan, and the Worlds rage, and all the Carnal policy of men of earthly Principles, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh his own Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>XXX.</label> The former being true, it is in its ſelf no ſtrange thing, nor ought to be matter of ſtumbling or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to any, that the Witneſſes of Chriſt in this our day direct their teſtimony againſt Civil Powers (as they are in their preſent conſtitution, bearing forth evidently the excellent brightneſſe, and the terrible form of the Great Image, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.31.) which yet Saints of formet Ages ſubjected themſelves unto, and never medled with, becauſe the caſe with them and us is vaſtly different. They lived within the compaſſe of that time in which the Great Image was to ſtand, the World and worldly Powers were to bear rule; which that they might do till their day ſhould come to an end, it was neceſſary that Saints in all Ages heretofore ſhould ſubject themſelves to them, and never bear a teſtimony ſimply and directly againſt Civil Powers of a worldly conſtitution: nor indeed could it be any part of their teſtimony, becauſe God having ſet a time how long worldly Powers ſhould continue, it behooved not them to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt before the time, to take from the World what by Divine permiſſion for ſuch a time was allotted them. But now the caſe is otherwiſe, for we being come to the beginning of that day, in which the Great Image muſt be ſmitten, till the ſame is crumbled to duſt, and finally carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the wind of Gods Wrath, and that Kingdom and Dominion which before the Great
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:115824:188"/>Image did hold as its by right, to bee tranſlated and given to the Saints of the moſt High; as every Work of God muſt have light for its Baſis, becauſe God leads his people to the execution of his will, not blinde-fold, but by light; therefore of neceſſity muſt the Witneſſes of Chriſt in this Age bear forth ſuch a teſtimony of truth as may lay a foundation in the hearts of Gods people for ſuch a work. And indeed, as the work that God is now about to do is a new thing in the World, <hi>viz.</hi> the regaining that Kingdom which hath been in the hands of the World for now upwards of two thouſand three hundred years (<hi>viz.</hi> ever ſince the beginning of the Seventy years Captivity in <hi>Babylon</hi>) ſo by the ſame reaſon, that truth which muſt be laid as foundation to this work, can bee no other but a new thing in the World. It is therefore no Argument againſt the truth of Chriſts viſible Kingdom, that Saints, our predeceſſors in the Ages before us, medled not with theſe things, nor ſtickled in ſuch a Cauſe or Controverſie as the Saints now do; it was then no part of their work, but it is now the Maſter-peece of ours.</p>
                  <p>And in caſe any then at that time did ſtickle, yet they brought nothing to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, becauſe they attempted Gods Work before his time. But now the time being come, as God hath in a more wonderful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than ever ſtirred up the hearts of his Saints to bear witneſſe, ſo ſhall not their Witneſſe-bearing (as to this great thing)
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:115824:189"/>be in vain; for let the Devil and the World do their worſt, the outward viſible King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Dominion, and the greatneſſe of the Kingdom under the whole Heaven ſhall revolve (and that ſuddenly) into the hands of the people of the Saints of the moſt High, who ſhall then take them Captives whoſe Captives they were, and ſhall bear rule over their Oppreſſors. <hi>Amen.</hi>
